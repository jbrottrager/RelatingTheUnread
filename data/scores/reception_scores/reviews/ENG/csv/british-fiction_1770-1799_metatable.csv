The first of these rules has been obeyed by Mr Palmer; and he has thrown his scenery back into the reign ofEdward the Third, an rera of chivalry and warlike enterprise, perfectly favourable to his design. His conception of the subject is, in other respects, sufficiently just: and by the introduction of a facetious Welch Squire, he has enlivened the solemnity of his graver scenes, with occasional flashes of humour. The romance is certainly executed with ability; and discovers such talents for the species of composition, as may be said to merit the protection of the public.'";
