Vertue Rewarded; OR, THE IRISH Princess. A NEW NOVEL.

She ne're saw Courts, yet Courts could have undone with untaught Looks, and an unpractis'd Heart; Her Nets, the most prepar'd, could never shun, For Nature spread them in the scorn of Art. Gond. lib. 2. Cant. 7.

THE Dedicatory Epistle To the Incomparable MARINDA.

Madam,

THIS Novel throws it self at your Feet, and pays you Ho∣mage as its Master's Representative:

It has been the product of some leisure hours, and will I hope do me this second kindness, to divert you in the Reading, as it did me in the Making. I need not, as others, give any reason for the Dedication; since to be made by me, is suffici∣ent to entitle it yours:

But that is not the only claim it can lay to your Favour; for in describing the Ma∣rinda of this Novel, I borrow from you, not only her Name, but some of the chief Beauties I adorn her with:

Though you may imagine she had no mean ones of her own, since (being but a private Gentlewoman) she could by their help alone make so sudden a Conquest over the Heart of a Prince, who had certainly (in so many Courts as he had been in) seen very agreeable Faces, set off with the additional Splendor of Quality, yet none of them had that effect o∣ver him, which hers gained without those advantages. Besides, her true Character suits very well with you:

She was an Innocent Country Vir∣gin, ignorant of the Intrigues and Tricks of the Court Ladies; her Vertue, like yours, untainted and undecayed, needed none of their Artificial Embellishments to guild it over; and that Innocence which appears eminently in both of you, as little wants these Ladies Artifices to set it off, as you do their Fucus for your Faces; since true Inno∣cence is as far beyond Dissimulati∣on, as your Colour is beyond all the Paint of the Town; in both of these you give Nature as signal a Triumph over Art, as ever she had in any two things whatsoever. I wish I could liken you to her in one thing more; that is, That your Servant were of as high Quality as hers; but this wish is made meerly for your sake:

For to me, as you are more precious than a Crown, so is the Title of a Prince inferiour to that Glorious one, of being the

Humblest of your Servants. The PREFACE TO THE Ill-Natur'd READER.

THe Dutchess of Suffolk, en∣tertaining once at her Table the Bloody Bonner, Bishop of Lon∣don, sate first by the Duke her Husband, but the Duke removing her thence, she went and sate by the Bishop, saying, That since she could not sit by him she loved best, she would next him she loved worst:

So dear dogged Reader, from writing an Epistle to her I love best, like the Dutchess, I change and remove to you whom I love worst: for Writers hate none so much as Ill-natured Readers:

Perhaps you'll ask, why then this Epistle to you whom I hate, and not rather to the Good-natured? Why for the same rea∣son that the Dutchess sate by Bonner, meerly to pass my Jest on you; though another may be given, which is, That since Prefaces were partly designed to make the Reader Indulgent and Fa∣vourable to the Book he is going to read, there's no need of a Preface to others, since the Good-Natured will be kind to it of themselves; but 'tis you, that put us to the trouble of Prefacing. Therefore to indear it the more to you know, that the main Story is true, I heard of a Gentleman who was acquain∣ted with the Irish Princess, and knew all the Intrigue, and having from him so faithful a Relation of it, I made the Scene the very same where it was transacted, the time the same, going on all the way with the Truth, as far as conveniency would permit; I only added some few Circumstances, and interlined it with two or three other Stories, for variety sake, which is as necessary to the setting off the true Relation, and making it pleasant, especially to you nice Readers, as Sauces are to the dressing up a Dish of Meat, to provoke the sickly Ap∣petite it is design'd for. I Printed it for the ease of her whom it was made for; if you like it, much good may do you; if you will not believe it, you have Liberty of Conscience; but whether you believe, or disbe∣lieve, like, or dislike, is indifferent to me, since in such a trivial thing as this, I no more fear discredit by writing a bad one, than I could hope for Fame in writing it well. But I believe you are eager to see what is in the Book, and therefore I'll detain you no longer.

Farewell. Vertue Rewarded; OR, THE IRISH Princess.

AS that mighty River which o∣verflows Aegypt, and, with its prevailing Torrent, often drowns those Provinces, which Nature only design'd it to water, yet proceeds at first from such mean begin∣nings, that most Geographers have been unable to trace it to its Spring:

So Loves swifter and more violent Stream has its first rise from such small Channels, such trifling circumstances, that the Heart it self can scarce perceive its Ori∣ginal; nay very often does not discern its progress, till it is too strong for it, and so the sudden vigour of its Torrent surprizes the unwary Lover, just as the Zudder Sea, driven with a North-west Wind, breaks the Diques, and over∣whelms the drowzy Hollander, before he suspects any danger. Yet so Natural is Self-conceit, and so Universal our pre∣tence to Knowledge, that few there are who will be so Modest, as to own them∣selves wholly Ignorant of any thing which you shall ask them a Reason for. Hence it is, that, among other things, Love too is understood by all, and not one but will give his Verdict of it as soon as you ask him:

The States-man will tell you it is caused by want of Ambition; the Merchant for want of Self-Interest; the Souldier for want of Action, and a thirst after Honour; and the Scholar will prove to you, that 'tis gotten by Idleness:

But it is with this, as with the Philosophers Stone, whose mysterious Nature all guess at, and none know what it is, for it very often breaks all the Rules that are prescribed against it:

Sets upon the States-man at Court, and over∣comes his Ambition; seizes on the Mer∣chant in his Counting-House, and weighs down his Interest; finds the Scholar in his Study, and teaches him a new System of Philosophy which baffles all the old; wounds the daring Souldier, even when he is clad in Steel, and makes him tamely submit to Captivity, in the very midst of his Conquests:

The Story that I am going to relate will be an excellent proof of this, being an Instance of an extraordinary sort:

It makes Love triumphant at once over two of these his greatest Enemies, the Noise of War, and the Vanity of Ambition; and shows you a Prince of great Valour, guarded equally by both of these, could not defend himself from the Powerful Eyes of a Forreigner, and one as far beneath him in Quality, as Love afterwards placed her above him, when he lay at her Feet imploring her Mercy. When our present King had fought the Battel at the Boyn, and drove the Routed Enemy into Limerick, he en∣deavoured to root up the War, by Re∣ducing that obstinate City, that durst hold out alone against the force of three Kingdoms, united in a Royal Army; he had then amongst his Forreign Troops several petty Princes, who fought under him; some as Volunteers, to learn the Art of War under so Great, so Experi∣enced a Master; some as Souldiers of For∣tune, who thought by their Valour to recommend themselves to his Favour, and obtain by that means some Impor∣tant Charge in the Army, the Honour and Profit of which might exalt and maintain them suitable to those High Characters which their Titles deserved. Among the latter sort may be reckon'd the Prince of S—g, the smallness of whose Principality not affording him an Income agreeable to his High Title, and Higher Mind, he was resolved to acquire that Plenty which his Fortune had de∣nied him, and show by his Valour, that he was nothing beholding to her for gi∣ving him Titles, but rather that she was unkind, in not giving him as plentiful a Revenue, as suited with the largeness of his Heart, and the vaster extent of his Merit. To this intent he came over Sea in a small Command, if we consider him as a Prince, though in a Post eminent enough to give him some occasions of publishing his Valour; 'twas in this Sta∣tion he was, when our Forces were from all parts drawing together to invest Li∣merick, in order to which our Prince was to march through Clonmell, a City in the County of Tipperary, scituated in a large Plain near the Sewer, now grown obscure, formerly famous for the great Battel fought just by it, between two Brothers who were Competitors for the Crown of Mounster; when that famous Island had five Crowned Heads to Govern its Inhabitants. It was the Chief Street of this Town our Prince was marching through, on Horse-back, at the Head of his Men, bowing low to both sides, which were fill'd all along with People, who crowded thither to see those Arms which were to secure them from the Ene∣mies of their Liberty and Religion; when lifting up his Eyes towards the Windows, which were fill'd with the chief Gentry of the City, he espied in one of them a Beauty which fixed his sight, as if she alone were worthy his Attention:

He continued looking that way, and tur∣ned not his Eyes off the Window, till the fieryness of his Horse (which could not indure to stand still) had carried him beyond the House, and left the delight∣ful Prospect behind him; and after∣wards he was so wholly taken up with the thoughts of what he had seen, that he rode on without regarding which way, till one of his Officers rode up, and told him that his Highness was past the House which was designed him for his Lodging:

The P. at this began to recollect himself, and giving Orders concerning the good Behaviour of his Souldiers, gave them leave to repair to their several Quarters, whilst he by the Head Officers was Con∣ducted to his; after some Ceremonies past they repaired to their rest, and left the Prince at liberty to take as much of his, as the inquietude of his Thoughts would permit him. He found himself tired with Travelling, and desirous of rest, yet incapable of taking any:

He found his Thoughts much disorder'd, and went to Bed to see whether Sleep would compose them:

His Soul, like the Bodies of those that have the Rheumatism, see∣med very weary; yet as their Limbs are still uneasie, though on the softest Beds, so was his Mind; and coveted sleep as much as their Limbs do rest, and could as little obtain it. O Love, thou most dangerous Distemper of the Soul! most dangerous because we do not perceive Thee, till Thou art too far gone to be cured:

Thou subtle Enemy! who takest the strongest Hearts, because Thou al∣ways usest Surprise; and undermining our Reason, never appearest in the light, till Thou art too far enter'd to be driven out: 'Twas thus, Treacherous Deity, Thou didst overcome our Prince, by at∣tacking him when he least was aware of Thee; he little feared Hostility in a Town which he enter'd as a Friend; nor did he expect that one, and that of the weaker Sex, should offer him Violence at the head of his Battalion. He sus∣pected the true Cause so little, that he wonder'd at his own inquietude, and could not imagine what it was that could keep him awake on a soft Bed, who used to sleep so sound in the Camp on a hard Quilt, and often on the Ground:

How∣ever, awake he lay all night, and did not once close his Eyes, till day-light shone in at his Window:

At the Sun's first ap∣pearance he got up, quite weary of his Bed, where he had the worst Nights rest he ever took in his Life; for though he had indured the hardship of many a cold night in Winter Camps; yet they all seemed easie and pleasant, in compa∣rison of this one Night's Fatigue; for all the thoughts in those Camps of Blood and War, the dread of a neighbouring E∣nemy, and the next day's Battel, were not so troublesome to his Repose, as those of his coming into this Town:

The whole Scene of his entrance intru∣ded into his Thoughts; the Noise and Hurry of the People was still in his Ears; and the Window, and the Charming Spectator that looked out of it, seemed still before his Eyes:

Though he scarce mistrusted that it was gone so far with him, as to be in Love; yet he was very desirous to come in Company with that beautiful-Stranger, who had been so much in his Thoughts, and to satisfie himself whether she was really so Lovely, as she appeared at a distance:

But neither knowing her Name, nor the place where she lived, he imagined that nothing but accident could bring him to a second sight of her; but as he was musing up∣on the difficulty of finding her out, Cela∣don, the Gentleman of his Horse, came to bid him Good-morrow, and acquain∣ted him, That two or three great Offi∣cers were below, waiting for admittance to speak with him:

The Prince, who was glad of any thing that might be an a∣musement to his troubled Mind, sent for them up, and received them with a great deal of Civility:

After the first Com∣plements, the Prince told them, He had Orders to await the King's coming to the Town; and after some discourse of the Progress of Affairs in general, they began to talk of the pleasure of Company, and how they should spend those few days which they were to pass in the Town:

One proposed Training the Souldiers, ano∣ther the Tavern, and the third a Consort of Musick; and when every one had past their Votes, the Prince bad Celadon give his:

This Celadon was a young brisk English Cavalier, of a small Stature, but a Soul sufficiently Great, and which dis∣dain'd to think that the littleness of his Body made him inferior to any one, ei∣ther in open Valour in the Field, or the management of an Intrigue at home:

And certainly never was any ones Hu∣mour more equally divided, between Love and War, than his:

He was an exact Volunteer in both, and as he would hazard his Person any time, and fight for him that would give him the best Promotion, so was he no less a Souldier of Fortune in Love than War; would change his side often, offer his Service to every Lady that would accept of it, and still was most hers, who was readi∣est to reward him:

He was the Younger Brother of a good Family; and having gone into Forreign Camps for a Liveli∣hood, he had by his Courage, Wit, and Good Fortune, raised himself so high into the Prince's favour, as to be made his Gentleman of Horse; he being to speak in his turn, told the Prince, That since they had left him a deciding Vote, he was for trying each of them by turns; and if they would begin with the Musick first, he would add to it one of his own most delighting Divertisements, the Company of Women; and to that pur∣pose, if the Prince pleased to be that Night at the Ball, he would take care to invite all the young Gentry of the Town to it:

The Prince told him he was the same he always thought him; that Celadon that took Love to be as important an Affair of Life, as either Eating or Drinking, and accordingly provided for it as carefully; this raille∣ry brought on other discourse, which lasted while Celadon went to make pre∣parations for the Ball; at last he came back and told them that all things were ready, and the Company invited. On one side of the Town stood a large Coun∣try House, which though not built af∣ter the Dorick Order, or the exacter neatness of Courtly Lodgings, yet its largeness gave liberty to guess at the Magnificence and Hospitality of the Owner:

It belonged to the Great Mora∣cho, famous all over the Kingdom for his Riches, particularly in his flocks of Sheep, as numerous as those of the mighty Scy∣thian, whose Son was the Terror of the World; or that Rich Man of the East, whom the Turkish Chronicles make Stew∣ard to Alexander the Great:

All his Ground, far and near, was thick covered with his fleecy Wealth:

You would hare thought by their bleatings that you were in Arcadia, and Shepherdism coming in fashion again: 'Twas this House which was pitched upon for the Ball; and what place so fit for Dancing and innocent Mirth, as a spacious Hall, whose Build∣ing, Size, and Furniture, altogether rustical, imprinted such lively Idea's of Country Freedom, and Country Inno∣cence:

Hither Celadon conducted our Prince and his Martial Company; their Musick was as good as the Town could afford, and their Reception suitable to the Riches and Hospitality of him that entertain'd them. The Prince, who went thither, rather to shun his former thoughts, than out of any inclination to the Company, or the Dancing, sat by, a Looker-on:

Some of the Officers who were not so seriously bent, took out those whose Face, Meen, or Shape plea∣sed them the best, and in their several Dances either shewed their Skill, or at least pleased themselves with the conceit that they did so. Celadon, who always employed such a time as this well, was not idle now; but gazed on one, talked to another bowed to the third, and left none of the Ladies unregarded; and as a cunning Hound, when he comes among a Herd of Deer, singles out the best, and never changes Scent, till he runs him down, so our skillful Hunter, who knew all the Mazes, Turnings, and Doublings in the course of Love, ranged through all the Company of the fairer Sex, till he lighted on the handsomest. He would not leave her, till he had prevailed with her to be his Partner in a Country Dance; and tho' till she was drawn out few observed her, because either Chance, or her own Modesty had placed her in a dark part of the Room, yet when she came into the light, she alone drew the admiration of all the Men, as she did the envy of the Women:

Her face was oval and somewhat thin, as if grief had but newly left it, yet her looks were as chearful, as if it had not left the least impression on her mind; some signs of the Small-pox were just perceivable, yet they and her thinness, instead of lessen∣ing, served rather to increase the repute of her Beauty, while they shew'd how it had triumphed over those two great de∣stroyers of the handsomest Faces:

Her Forehead was high and smooth, as if no Frown had ever deformed it to a wrin∣kle; and as much beyond the whiteness of the rest of her Sex, as theirs is beyond the browner Complexion of ours; her Neck, and all the parts of her Face were equally Snowy, except her Cheeks; but they, as if they received their colour from the Rays which her Eyes darted down on them, were of such a lively Carnation, as if that and the rest of her Face were at a strife, which of those two Colours were the best. Her Eyes were of the same azure of the clearest Sum∣mer Skyes, and, like them too, so shining, that it would dazle you to look on them, and her Brows, which grew over them in an exact Arch, were inclining to a light colour, as if they got it from the brightness of those Beams which shone from beneath them. Her Stature was neither so low as that Sex usually is, nor so till as to seem too masculine; her Shape was curiously slender, and all her Limbs after a feminine delicacy, but she had withall a Deportment so Great and so Majestick, that the comeliness of the stronger Sex was mixed with the graces of the weaker:

And that the stateliness of her Carriage seemed to command that Love and Adoration, which the sweet∣ness of her Face did invite to. I will not describe how she was drest, let those Ladies be set off with such helps, who like Peacocks owe their Price to their Feathers; hers were no part of her Beauty, they were put on for Modesty, not for Ornament; and served her as Clouds do the Sun, to screen her more glorious Beauties from the Eyes of weak Mankind, who would else be as infalli∣bly ruined by the sight of the one, as by the excessive heat of the other. The Prince, who sate looking on the Dance, no sooner saw her, but he knew her to be the same whom he had seen in the Win∣dow, and whom he so much longed to come acquainted with, he was o∣verjoy'd that he had gotten an opportu∣nity he so little expected; he was so ea∣ger to speak to her, and so impatient till the Dance was over, that any one who had observed him might easily have perceived it:

As soon as the Dance was ended, he call'd to Celadon, and telling him that he could not but be weary, prof∣fered to supply his place: Celadon, with a great deal of submission told him, that he was willing to resign any place to his Highness, and so sate down:

In the mean time a Tune began, and the Lady waited for her Partner; but when she saw the Prince come, she blush'd, and de∣sired his Highness would pardon her, if she pray'd him to chuse another, because she was weary:

The Prince would not allow of that excuse; but when she Danced several times wrong, and put the Company out, and was out of Coun∣tenance her self, he thought her blush∣ing proceeded from her not understan∣ding the Dance, and so accepted the ex∣cuse, and sate down with her. Having a mind to discourse with her, and not having so good a command of the Eng∣lish Tongue, he spoke to her in French, and asked her, did she understand him? she answered him again in the same Language:

Sir, I have just such a smattering of it as you have of English, but your Highness shows me so wise a President, of not ven∣turing to discourse in a Language which I cannot express my self well in, that I ought to follow it, and dare no more speak French to your Highness, than you will English to me.

Madam, said the Prince, though you speak the French Tongue so prettily, that one does not know which becomes your Mouth bet∣ter, that, or your own, yet e're a one of them is thrown away on you; for that tempting Face speaks so much of 
it self, that had Nature ty'd up your Tongue, yet your Looks alone have power enough to lead all Mankind a∣stray, and draw them more attractive∣ly after you by their Eyes, than the most perswading Eloquence can by the Ears.

Sir, replyed the Lady, Had your Highness made these Compliments to some celebrated Beauty, custom would have prepared her an Answer; but to one that is so unused to them as I am, they come so unexpected, that I must desist Discoursing, as I did just now from Dancing, not so much because I am weary of it, as because I do not know how to go on; and really, with us Country Maids, our Tongues walk like our Feet, and as our Country Dances follow an easie methodical way, so does our Talk; whilst your Court Wit, like your dances, are so made up of Art in one place, a cunning Jest, or a hard Step in another; your Fan∣cies, like your Feet, do caper so high, and are so nimble, that our plainness seems ridiculous in both, and yours is so difficult to us, that it gives us no hope of ever arriving to as much as a faint imitation.

Dancing, said the Prince, was design'd in imitation of 
Courtship, the Ladies flying off from the Man to shew her Coyness; her some∣times coming forward, and sometimes retiring, her inconstancy; and their meeting at last signifies their Marriage; now if the Fashion be here as 'tis in our. Country, to kiss at last, i'faith, Ma∣dam, I'll leave Poets and Dancing-Ma∣sters to shew their Skill in Talking and Dancing, and care not how unskillful∣ly I go on in either, so that I may be sure of my reward in the end:

If you go no farther than a bare kiss, replyed the Lady smiling, few would refuse your Highness that reward, to have the ho∣nour of Dancing with you; but if you carry on the Simile so far as to relate to Marriage, your Highness should con∣sider, that the sport of Courtship, like that of Dancing, is quite gone when it comes to the kiss; and no more plea∣sure remains afterwards to the poor tired Dancers, than that of thinking it over again; for then, as an old say∣ing of ours has it, our dancing days are gone.

As she spoke those words, the Dance ended, and some of the Com∣pany coming up to hearken to their dis∣course, the Lady rose from her Seat, and took her leave; the Prince could neither persuade her to stay, nor to give him leave to wait on her home; then he de∣sired to know where she lived, but she begg'd his Pardon:

The Prince, who was resolved to know her, sent his Page to observe her, and to take notice where she lodged, and so fell in talk with the other Company, continuing it with one or o∣ther, till the lateness of the night broke up the Ball, and sent every one to his several home; the Prince had not been long at his, e're the Page came and brought him word, that he had housed the Lady in the High-street, that she lived there with a Gentlewoman who was her Mother-in-law:

The Prince who was so uneasie before, and so desi∣rous to see her, since he had that inter∣view he wished for, began to be more at ease, though more in Love than be∣fore, and whereas his thoughts were formerly distracted several ways, now they ran all on her; the Ball, the Dancing, and all the rest of the Enter∣tainment was as faintly remembred, as if he had only seen them in a Dream; but what she had said or done, was as fresh, as if it were that very moment act∣ing over again:

One while he fancied he saw her Dancing, another, that he saw with what a grace she spake, and every word of her discourse was as rea∣dy in his memory, as if they were the only ones engraven there; no wonder if those who will not give credit to the Stories of Apparitions, say, the Persons are deluded by the excess of Fear, and the strength of their own Fancies, for the force of imagination is as strong in Love as it is in Fear, and makes the cheated Amourist still think he sees the Fair one, and though she be an hundred mile off, yet her Face, her Ayr, her Meen, and every thing that formerly pleased his sight, seems still to dance before it:

And as the guilty Conscience of the Mur∣derer presents the Fantom of the Mur∣dered to his view, so Lovers are haun∣ted with Spectres too, only the Murde∣rers appear in a dreadful, the Lovers in a pleasing Form. This Night had our Prince several of these delightful Visi∣ons, which were so intruding, that nei∣ther his Reason could banish them while he was awake, nor Sleep free him from them in his Dreams; as soon as he wa∣ked he sent for Celadon, and having or∣dered him to shut the Door, and sit down on his Bed-side, he spake thus to him.

When you went with me to the 
Emperour's Court, do you remember how many excellent Beauties we saw there? What variety too, Black, Brown, and Light, yet all fair to Per∣fection; you may remember how in∣different I was to them all, that I ne∣ver threw away an hours discourse on them, unless it were to rally the Pride, the Hypocrisie, the Ambition, and the other Vanities which that Sex is given to; and then though I seem'd in Jest, yet I took what I spake to be truth, nor did I think that the low opinion I had of Woman-kind would ever let me shew them any regard beyond bare Complaisance: But I was deceived, for I have in these two days had a greater alteration in my humour, than I be∣lieved my whole life could produce:

By your words, Sir, I should guess, said, Celadon, that you are in Love, but the consideration of the place where we are corrects that thought, since in this Island there is scarce one worthy your high Affections.

I wish you could per∣swade me to that, reply'd the Prince; but will not you recant your own Opinion, when I recall to your mind the Beauti∣ful Partner you last Night danced with?

The young Gentlewoman, reply'd he, 
had as large a stock of Beauty, as the most Romantick Lover can either wish or imagine in a Mistress; and indeed, if your Highness has a mind to Intrigue away this Winter that's coming on, I could not wish you a pleasanter than she is likely to make, if her Wit be answerable to her Beauty:

By what small tryal I have had of her, answered the Prince, I believe it falls very little short of it; and if my Love for her en∣creases a little longer, at the same rate as it has done since its birth, I fear 'twill out-live more Campaigns with me, than I shall Winters with her:

Why sure, said Celadon, your High∣ness does not design any more than a Jest in't; for though her Person de∣serves a higher station in the World, yet, since Fortune has given her nei∣ther Quality nor Riches suitable to it, you are not so prodigal a Lover as Mark Anthony was, to quit your Princi∣pality, and your Honour besides, for a Mistress:

There's no need of that, said the Prince; don't lay such Blockadoes in my way to her; for be it ever so long, or difficult, I will use both Pa∣tience and Diligence to overcome it; for some way or other I am resolved to 
enjoy her; and if you will assist me, I shall not think all that ever I can do for you will make you too large a re∣compense.

Your Highness, said Cela∣don, never yet gave me an opportuni∣ty to shew my diligence in serving you; but if you please to tell me how you in∣tend to bring this about, I will follow your directions to the utmost of my Power:

All that I would desire of you at present, said the Prince, is to make me an English Song, because I am not well enough acquainted with the Tongue; make it to the Tune we heard sung to Count Epithalamium, and with your Violin and my Guittar we'll go this Night and Serenade her:

I'll take my leave of you now, said Cela∣don, and in the Afternoon I'll wait on you with the Song.

Celadon fail'd not his promise, but came in the Evening, and sat drinking with the Prince till Mid-night, and then they sallied out, to go to the place where they meant to Sere∣nade, taking the Prince's Page with them, both to carry their Instruments, and shew them the House. When they were come under the Window, they play'd a while in Consort, till they thought they had awaken'd those of the House, and then the Prince bad Celadon give over, and setting his Guittar to answer his Voice, with a passionate Air he sang this Song,

WHy should my fair Enchantress sleep, And yet not dream at all of those, Whom Love of her in torment keep, And hinders from the least repose: She has kindled fires in my breast, Which keep me still awake, And robs her Lover of that rest, Which she her self does take.

When he had Sung thus far he heard the Casement open, and one whisper out of it:

Who are you that distrust your own Person and Wit so much, that you make your Court by Musick, to help out the one; and chuse Mid-night for the time to pay your visits in, that Darkness may conceal the defects of the other?

The Prince (because 'twas a Woman's Voice, and because he would willingly have it so) concluded that it was his Mistress, and therefore answer∣ed her:

Those, Madam, who have such Beauty as yours to plead with, ought in their own defence to come in the dark, because in the light, the sight of you would take up so 
much of their thoughts; that when they have most need of them, to express the greatness of their passion, they'd then be at the greatest loss what to say:

You little think how much you are in the right (said she) for could you see me 'twould spoil your Complementing; for there's nothing so much a bugbear to Wit as an ugly Face:

Saying this she clapt to the Window, and nothing which the Prince could afterwards say gain'd any return. He, thinking his Sport over for that Night, looked about for Celadon, but no Celadon to be found, nor could the Page give any tydings of him:

The Prince thought he might be gone home before him, and therefore followed him, in expectation to know how he came to leave him, and to tell him of his Discourse with the Lady. Here per∣haps the Reader may charge Celadon with Incivility, in running home before the Prince, when he had promised to keep him company; but let the hasty Censurer have as much patience as the Prince himself, who did not expect to see Celadon, till he got to his Lodging, and when he came there, was as far to seek for him as ever; but the next mor∣ning, the first who came into his Cham∣ber was Celadon, his Complexion was wan, and looked as if he was much out of order:

The Prince, who guessed he had been upon an Amour, asked him, what made him look so ill.

After ha∣ving begg'd your Highness's Pardon, said he, for my rudeness in leaving you, I'll tell such an accident which befell me since, that your Highness will think a sufficient punishment for it:

While you were Singing, I saw at a little di∣stance something, which, by the white∣ness, I guessed to be either a Ghost, or a Woman, and as I am not afraid of either, my Curiosity prompted me to see which it was, I walked that way, and found it to be, not a Ghost, but which was worse, a Shee-Devil in a Night-rail, by which I concluded it to be of that Sex which I had most incli∣nation to keep company with at that time of Night; the place too seemed to favour the Temptation, being an old Abby, where there was no body nigh to interrupt us:

When I came near her, she broke silence first, and said,

O Lord, Sir, you have staid very long, I have been waiting for you this hour:

Tho' at first, by her standing there, I thought her Common, yet these words made me take her for some Lover who had
made an Assignation; I was resolved to personate him whom the meeting was designed for; and lest she should know my Voice, I answer'd in a low tone, that business hinder'd me, but I would soon make amends for my ab∣sence:

Just as he spoke this last word, be runs to the Chamber-door, and ha∣ving seized a Maid of the House, he hall'd her in, crying out,

This is the Jilt that play'd me the trick, but I'll be re∣venged on her:

The Maid half dead with fear, could say nothing for her self, but cry'd to the Prince for help; he seeing her gentilely drest, and think∣ing 'twas his Landlord's Daughter, in∣terposed his Authority, and ordering the Door to be shut, commanded Cela∣don to be calmer, till he enquired into the matter, and asked the Stranger whe∣ther she knew what was the reason of his Anger:

The Maid desiring that his Highness would hear her, and then judge between them, began thus:

I perceive by this Gentleman's Anger, that he has been grosly abused; that I have been in some sort the cause, I am sorry; but to shew you I am a very innocent one, I'll give you a relation of some passages of my life, which 
though publickly known, yet never should have been told you by me, were it not on such an important account as this, the allaying this Gentleman's rage against me, and the hindering him from noising any thing abroad, which might be to the prejudice of my Reputation:

My Father is a Country Gentleman, descended from a good Family, but his Ancestors were so im∣provident, as to spend most of their Estate, and leave him but a small re∣mainder to maintain a great many Children:

I am the youngest of all, the Favourite both of Father and Mo∣ther, whose greatest care has been to Match me so, that they may live to see me happy. I had choice enough; for these three or four years I have had lit∣tle rest from Suitors, who from all parts of the Country sollicited me:

My Fortune, I believe, they did not court me for, because I saw several who had far greater were neglected; People flatter'd me indeed with the title of a Beauty, and Fame, who is most com∣monly a great Lyar; did list my Name among her wonders; whether she was in the wrong or no, I could wish she were, for it has put me to more trou∣ble 
than a good Face is worth, to bear with the several impertinencies of my young Country Servants; though to have seen their several humours would have been as good as a Comedy to me, had I been meerly a Spectator, but I lost the pleasure because I was an Actress in it my self:

Every one of them had a particular behaviour, yet every one something of the Harlequin in it; and their Courtship was different, ac∣cording to their diversity of humours:

One had Confidence, and thought that would gain me, and he'd be the most troublesome, because he'd touze me and hale me about, and I had much ado to defend my self from his rude∣ness; him I avoided as I would the Devil. Another would think to gain me by his over-civility, and he'd come a great way just to ask me how I did, and how my Father and Mother did, ask me what a Clock it was, and what time of the Moon, and where I was at Church last Sunday; and after some such wise discourse, he'd take a kiss and be gone; he was my Chip in Por∣ridge, I neither shunn'd his Company, nor cared for it. A third, pufft up with the good success of having gotten 
his Father's Maid, or Tenant's Daugh∣ter with Child, believed the same Me∣thods would conquer me, and there∣fore thought to entertain me with im∣modest discourse; my Vertue made me deaf to all he could say, and for my Reputation sake I avoided him. Then a Widower came, a Cousen, addressed to me, desiring to be nearer a-kin, and thought to touch my heart, but indea∣voured it after so rude a manner, as if he forgot that 'twas a Maid, not a Widow, he was Courting:

But it ap∣peared, for all his long practising Mer∣chandise, that he did not understand how to Purchase, for all that he had in the World could not buy my consent to give him mine. A fifth was opiniona∣tive of his rustick valour, and he'd aim at conquering his Mistress the same way as Knights Errant did of old, by quarrelling and beating every one he came near:

But I thought such an o∣ver-boyling Courage, which would still expose me to fears for him, was fitter for a Bravo, than a Husband. The sixth was my true Country Courtier, who was all Innocence; he had scarce Courage enough to keep him from swooning, when he came into my 
Company, unless his Spirits had been raised before-hand, by a dram of the Bottle, or a belly full of strong drink; then he'd say, his Mother sent him to ask me whether I'd have him; and tell me a long story of his Ground, his Dairy, and his Cattle; I despised this Milk∣sop, and thought it a hard bargain to give my self in subjection to the chief Beast, only to be Mistress of the rest. This was my condition, when a young Gentleman, a Stranger, came down into our Country to some Friends he had there; and no sooner saw me, than he encreased the number of my Captives, and professed himself my Servant, but when he first old it me, 'twas with all the Rhetorick which an ingenious passion could invent, his Eyes, his Actions, and every gesture so gracefully seconded his Story, that the Lover's part, which the others acted so ridiculously, became him so well, as if he were only made for Love. When he paid a visit, if any of the rest chanced to come at the same time, the Breeding which he brought from Dublin, elevated him so far above them, in his Discourse, his Carriage, and all he did, that they did look like our
wild Irish to him; but when alone he talked to me of Love, the Musick of his Tongue was so enchanting, I could have staid and listen'd for ever to him. Sir, I will say no more in his commen∣dation, for methinks Lovers are so much a part of our selves, that their praises look fulsome where they come from one another, I will only tell your Highness that we were but too happy in one another, till Fortune, who is never constantly kind, contrived a way to part us asunder:

But why should we curse our ill Fortune, or lay the fault on the Devil, when any mischance does befall us? Whereas poor Beelze∣bub is wrong'd, for he could not do us half the mischiefs we receive, unless we helped him against one another, and of all people I think the Envious are his principal Agents, of which this is a remarkable instance:

There lived in the same House with him, one Capella, a stale Maid, of a good Family, but a decayed Fortune, and she, it seems, hearing of our Amour, envied the hap∣piness of it:

I can't say 'twas out of any violent Love to him, for her being pretty far advanced in years, and sick∣ly besides, do make me think her Lo∣ving 
time was past, at least I'm sure it should have been, for her grey Hairs, her Dwarfishness, her Sickliness, her Pale Ill-favoured Face, and her want of a Fortune to gild all these Imper∣fections, might have hindered her from thinking of Marriage, if she had any Wit to consider them; but she will repent the want of it, when the foolish desire of Intriguing in her old Age, has rendered her ridiculous to all the Gen∣tlemen, and after wasting her Youth in Pride and Disdain of those that more than deserved her, make her take up at last, for want of a better, with a Ploughman, a Groom, or a Footman. I fear your Highness will think this a very illnatur'd Character, but I will beg you to consider, that it proceeds from her own deserts, and the resentment an in∣jured Love does usually raise in our Breasts, against those who are the chief causes of our unhappiness; as certainly she was of mine, for the Nets she often, and in vain, spread for others, were now laid for him:

And because she thought the Love of me diverted him; after having with Jeers and Perswasi∣ons, Scorn and Flattery, Anger and Kindness, and all the different ways 
she could think on, in vain attempted to shake his Constancy; she was resol∣ved to make me lose him, though she lost him her self by it; and getting some of her Relations to represent me to his, as disadvantageously as they could, they (lest he should loiter a∣way his Youth in Love, and not pur∣sue that Preferment to which his Geni∣us was likely to raise him) called him up to Dublin. I, partly to hush the discourse which her Malice had raised of us, about the Countrey, partly, be∣cause it made me melancholly, to see those deserted Shades, where I had for∣merly been so happy, quitted that place, and chose my Aunt's House, where your Highness is, now, for my retirement. He came to Town, incog∣nito, to see me, and for fear some of his Friends should hear of it, our meet∣ings were always in private. An Ab∣bey hard by (being solitary and free from any company that might disturb us) we pitched upon for our last nights Assignation:

I was there first, and this Gentleman coming by, I mistook him for the other:

He'll own himself that he began to be too familiar, and lest he should offer me violence at that time 
of night, when no body was near to help me, I was driven to this shift to get rid of him:

I saw which way his nature inclined him, and thence con∣cluded there was no way to deliver my self, but by putting him in hopes of some better Intrigue; I therefore told him, I would not detain him from my Mistresses's Embraces, who had been waiting for him this long while (pre∣tending I mistook him for some other Gentleman) and so drew him from thence, designing at the first House I saw any up, to pretend she was there, and so leave him:

I durst not come home with him, lest the vexation of finding himself deceiv'd, should make him raise the House, and to come home with an Officer at that time of Night, would have ruined me in my Aunt's good opinion. It fell out as well as I could wish, for an Ale-house was o∣pen, and desiring him to go and en∣quire for her there, I bad him good night, and came home as fast as my fear could carry me:

What became of him after I know not, only desire that he would impute it to his own Curiosi∣ty, if he has suffered; and that both your Highness and he will be so honou∣rable, 
as to keep what I have related from others Ears, as strictly as I would have kept it from yours, had I not been constrained to reveal it in justifi∣cation of mine Honour.

The Prince, who had listened with delight to the Love-story, it jumping so well with the humour he was then in, told the young Gentlewoman, that he had a great re∣spect for her, as she was a Gentlewo∣man, and so near a Relation of his Land∣ladies, but more, as she was Beautiful, Vertuous, and a Lover, and wished her a great deal of Success. Celadon begg'd a thousand pardons for the rudeness his Ignorance had betray'd him to; and that she might be the more inclined to pardon him, he desired her to stay, and hear the unlucky adventure he had after she left him. The Prince desired her to seat her self, and Celadon with half a smile, and a blush together, thus continued his Story. You may remember, Madam, that I promised you to make amends for my long stay, and went about to be as good as my word, had not your Ver∣tue and Cunning restrained me more than my own:

And tho' I have all along said that no Woman could resist Oppor∣tunity and Importunity, yet now I re∣nounce my Error, and could my self be∣come a Proselyte to Chastity, were I so happy as the Gentleman you waited for, I mean, in having so Fair, so Vertuous a Mistress, to regulate my wandering de∣sires, and confine them to her self; as it is, your example, and last nights trick put upon me, have half Converted me:

I will own to you, that I did really think you had mistaken me for another; I was big with hopes of the Bliss you promised to conduct me to; and 'twas either your wisdom, or good luck, not to go into the light with me; I saw indeed so much of you, as to know you again by your Cloaths; but had I seen that alluring Face, your feigned Mistress had not ser∣ved your turn; I did not, because I a∣voided your seeing mine, for fear you should discover me to be the wrong Per∣son:

For the same reason, I was loath to ask your Mistress's Name, and chose rather to enquire for her at a venture, concluding, that if I once came into her Company, the fear of my discove∣ring her Amour would over-awe her, and make her as kind to me, as if I were the Spark that she waited for:

Besides, the heat of my Inclination pushed me for∣ward at a venture, whether I succeeded or no:

I went therefore into the House, and asked a Boy at the Bar, whether there was ever a Gentlewoman there who expected me:

The Boy asked me what her Name was:

What's that to you, said I? Is there ever a Gentlewoman in the House?

The Boy, who understood his Trade, guessed what I meant; shewed me a Room, and sent in a Woman to me:

Her colour was very good, for I believe she was Painted, her Look was brisk, and her Garb gentile enough; for my Garb being pretty rich, they thought to make a good Prize of me, and there∣fore sent me, I suppose, the choicest Girl in the House. I took her to be the distressed Wife of some old Man, who had married her to make her his Nurse, and therefore told her it belong'd to my Pro∣fession to help the distressed. She told me she thought, by my Tone and Whiskers that I was an Out-landish Man; asked me how long I had been in Town, and whe∣ther I was a meer stranger to that place; pretending as if she was afraid of my coming to the knowledge of whose Wife she was. I told her I was an English-man, had been beyond Sea several years; that I came to Town but two or three days ago, with the Prince's Troops, and should suddenly be marching to Limerick, and that therefore she should make the better use of me while I staid, and never fear a discovery afterwards; by this she guessed I should never be able to find the House again; and that embolden'd them to deal as they did with me; she seemed to be so cautious, out of a fear of her Honour; when therefore she had gotten as much knowledge of my being a Stran∣ger, as satisfied her fears, she began to be more familiar with me, and, out of a particular piece of kindness, would needs send out for a Bottle of Sack for me, saying, she would drink a health to the good man at home; we both laugh'd at the conceit; I, how little he thought of his Horns, and she to think how lit∣tle I suspected the Trick she was going to play me:

The Wine she would needs drink mull'd, and, ordering it her self, she infused either Opiate, or some such Soporiferous draught; we had no sooner drank it off, than she consented to go to Bed, saying, that her Husband was out of Town, and the House belonging to a Friend of hers, no body was likely to trouble our pleasures:

Because I sus∣pected nothing, I never minded how little she drank; and you know, Madam, we usually indulge Women their liber∣ty in drinking, therefore very likely she drank less, and so it might have less o∣peration upon her; it worked so on me, that I did not wake till late in the mor∣ning, and when I first opened my Eyes, I found my self in the innermost part of the Abby, which I saw you at last Night; I was laid on a Tombstone, by the side of a great Marble Statue (the Effigies of some Great Person formerly buried there) I wonder'd to find that my Bed and Bedfellow had both suffered such a Niobetick alteration, that they who were so soft and warm last Night, were become so hard and cold by Mor∣ning; but I wonder'd more at my self, when I found no Cloaths, but an old Franciscan Habit on me, I began to think of Plato's transmigration, and that I had died an Officer, and for my lewd∣ness in my former body, was doom'd now to be an abstinent Franciscan: But I had not much time to think, for by this time, a zealous Neighbour that had seen me asleep, thought he would catch the Frier napping, and brought a Con∣stable for me; the Man of Authority order'd me immediately to appear be∣fore a Justice of Peace. I was conducted in State through the Streets, at the head of a Party, more numerous than your Highness's body of Souldiers; they huz∣za'd all the way, as if the King were going by; and methought I went in great Pomp, only my Triumph was after the Roman fashion, with the Lictor behind me, who every now and then threat'ned me with Bridewell, the Stocks, and the Gibbet:

In this manner I marched near half a mile to the Justice's, barefooted all the way, which I think of it self was suffici∣ent pennance for my last nights Debauch:

The Justice asked me a great many im∣pertinent questions; as how I durst ap∣pear there in that Habit? and why I did not go after the French to Limerick? I saw it best to confess what I was, and told him all the latter part of my adventure, how that the People of the House know∣ing, by my own confession, that I was a Stranger, and not likely to find the House again, had robb'd me of all my Cloaths at Mid-night, and left me there in an old Habit, which some poor Holy Brother had formerly given them as the return of a kindness:

The Justice would not believe but this was a Jesuitical eva∣sion of mine, and therefore bad me, if I was a Souldier, send for some body that I was acquainted with; I named two or three Officers of my Acquaintance, and the Justice sent one for them, they were found in a Tavern with a great deal of other Company, and the fellow deliver∣ing his Message publickly, they all came to see the Novice in his Habit; their Testimony released me, and I was fain to borrow some Cloaths to go home in, having lost a very good Suit of my own, and most part of the ready Money I have in the World, and have got nothing for it, but the name of Celadon the Francis∣can, which will stick by me as long as I live:

Your Highness may see now the cause of my paleness, is the potion I drank, and the cold Lodging I had, which if it had not happen'd at such a hot time of the year, would have made me dye in a more Religious Habit than ever I lived in. You, Madam, if you have any such thing as pity in you, will excuse me, and think that the shame, the loss, and the cold I suffered might be sufficient cause to make me angry with you, whilst I thought you one of the Ac∣complices. The fair Stranger, with a pi∣tying smile, told him, That she was sorry he had suffered so much by her means, and said, that to shew she did no way consent to it, she would send one who should shew him the House; and if he would carry a Constable with him, he might recover all his things again. The Prince, who had laughed till he was weary, bad Celadon call up the Centry, him he sent for a File of Musqueteers, and desiring the beautiful Stranger to send a Guide with them to the House, sent Celadon with them. The young Gentlewoman, bidding the Prince good morrow, went to her Uncle and Aunt to give them some share of the Laugh∣ter, and ordering one of the Servants to go with the Souldiers to the House, there Celadon found his last nights Mistress, and having recovered his Cloaths and his Watch, he sent for the same Consta∣ble, who had conducted him so carefully to the Justice's, and leaving his Mi∣stress, and her fellow Nuns to the pub∣lick Justice, he came back to the Prince very well satisfied that he had come off so well, and bought his experience so cheap. Though the oddness of Cela∣don's adventure did for some time em∣ploy the Prince's mind, yet at last, by a long chain of thought, he returned to the accustomed Subject his Mistress:

For as the Jack of the Lanthorn is said to lead the benighted Country-man about, and makes him tread many a weary step in fruitless rounds, yet leaves him near the same place where it found him at first; so Love's deluding fire, after enticing the blinded mind through many restless thoughts, brings it about again to its beloved Idea, that enchanting circle it can never leave; 'twas this bewitching Passion which brought our Prince from Celadon's adventure to the fair Stran∣gers, and from hers to his own; and when he call'd to mind the Story of her Lover, and his success over her heart, he pleased himself with hopes of the like Fortune in his own Amour, and thought it very probable, that a Prince, who had several advantages over one of a private Fortune, might expect the same success, and not fear the like dis∣appointment, since he had no power to over-awe, or check his Love, or Relati∣ons to controul it. Finding a great deal of diversion in this melancholly en∣tertainment, he resolved on a walk, as well to take the Air, as to prevent the engaging himself in any Company, which might come to seek him at his Lodgings; when he had walked about half a mile, he found himself on the top of a Hill, whence after having looked a while on the adjacent Town, and with a curious Eye searched out that part of it, which his admired Beauty made happy with her presence, he laid him down under the shade of two or three large Trees, whose spreading Boughs nature had wo∣ven so close together, that neither the heat of the Sun, nor storm of the fier∣cest Wind could violate the pleasant shade, which was made as a general de∣fence, no less against the scorching of the one, than the nipping of the other; they seemed to have been first planted there, for the shelter of those who came thither to drink; for just by there bub∣bled up a clear and plentiful Spring, of which, from an ancient Irish Chronicle, let me give you this Story. Cluaneesha, the only Child of Macbuain, King of Munster, was accused of having been too familiar with one of her Father's Cour∣tiers; the Fact was attested upon Oath by two Gentlemen that waited on the King's Person, and to confirm it, the Princess her self had such a swelling in her, that few doubted but their Witness was true, and would soon be proved by her being brought to Bed:

Her Father, being old and sickly, was desired, for the prevention of Civil Wars after his Death, to nominate a Successour:

The People shewed their unanimous consent to confer the Crown on her Uncle, be∣cause they would not have a Strumpet for their Sovereign; so the old King was perswaded to proclaim his Brother Heir Apparent, and condemn his Daughter to a Cloister:

The Courtier fled beyond Sea, and went a Pilgrimage to the Saint at Posnanie; the very night that he ar∣rived there, one appeared to the Mo∣ther Abbess, in the form of a Nun glo∣rified, and told her, that she was Edith, Daughter formerly to King— but now in happiness; that she loved Cha∣stity and Innocence while she was on Earth, and therefore defended it still; that she was constrained to leave the seat of Bliss to protect Vertue, injured in the Person of Cluaneesha; that the Per∣sons who swore against her were su∣born'd; that the swelling of her Belly was but a Disease; and that if she and the witnesses would go and drink of a Well, which sprung out of a Hill near Clonmell, there she would convince all the Spectators, that what she now told her was true:

The Abbess told this the next day to the King's Confessor, and he told it the King; the King ordered one who was Confessor to the two Witnesses, to enjoin them, for their next pennance, to drink no other Liquor, but the Water of this Well, for a Week together; they obey'd him, but it was their last, for it made them swell as if they were poisoned; in the mean time the Mother Abbess came down thither with her Royal Novice. She charged them with the Perjury, and they confessed publick∣ly, that the King's Brother, taking the advantage of that swelling, which he thought was but a Tympany, suborned them to swear against her Chastity, ex∣pecting that either it would kill her, or at least it might deceive the People so long till the King was dead, and he in possessi∣on of the Crown:

A certain Citizen of Clonmell, who came among the rest to see them dying, and heard the Confession, admiring the strange virtue of the Wa∣ter, went immediately home to his Wife, and telling her that he was sus∣pitious of her Honesty, and desired that, to satisfie his Jealousie, she would drink a draught of Water, and wish it might be her last, if she were unfaithful:

She not having yet heard of the others pu∣nishment, and willing to clear her self, drank of it as he desired, but swell'd with it as the others did, and dyed soon after in great torment. When the Well had grown famous by the exemplary deaths of the Perjured Witnesses, and the A∣dulterate Citizen, the Princess declared she would drink of it too; and that the clearing of her self might be as publick as her accusation was, she sent up to the King, who was then at Cork, to desire that her Uncle himself might be present when she drank, to witness her inno∣cence; he excused himself, and would not go, but a great many of the Court coming thither to see the Princess clear her self, she went in solemn Procession barefoot, from the City to the Well; and taking up a glass full of the Water, she protested her Innocence, and using the same imprecation with the others, if she did not speak the truth, drank it off; but instead of working the same effect on her, it in a little time cured her of the Disease she had, recovered her Health, and with it brought her so much Beauty, that all the neighbouring Princes were Rivals for her:

She had design'd to build a Nunnery by that Well, but her Father dying left her the cares of a Crown, which diverted her from it: But the Well was long after reverenced, and for the quality it had of discovering Unchastity, it was much resorted to; for the Inhabitants of Ireland (how bar∣barous soever the partial Chronicles of other Nation report 'em) were too nice in Amour to take a polluted Wife to their Bed, as long as this Well would shew them which was a chast one; but the wickedness of after times grew too guilty to bear with such Tryals; thence by difuse this Well lost its Fame, and per∣haps its Vertue. And now I will no longer tell such Tales, but leave the un∣certain Lover to take his Lot as it comes. Pretty near this Well the Prince lay down, and being pleased with the mur∣muring of its Stream running down a descent of the Hill, that, and his want of Sleep the night before, tempted him to take it now; Morpheus was ready at his call, and waving his Leaden Rod o∣ver him, lull'd all his Senses, till a grea∣ter power than he rescued him from sleep, to Charm him in a more prevai∣ling manner; for as he waked he heard one hemm, and found it was in order to Sing, for presently the unknown, with a ravishing Air, began this Song.
YIeld, Souldier, yield, give up your Sword, And don't rebel in vain, Yield on all conquering Beauty's word, And take what quarter she'll afford, And you shall wear the lighter Chain.
Why do you put such trust in Art? In vain, fond Wretch, you Arm, And think Steel proof 'gainst Beauty's dart, Which will, like light'ning, pierce you Heart, yet do your Coat of Mail no harm. 

The excellency of the Voice, and the suitableness of the Sence to his own con∣dition, made him lye still to hearken to her that Sung it, and listening very at∣tentively, he over-heard another Voice, which breaking silence began thus. I thank you, dear Marinda, for the Song, I like the Tune you have put to it, and either that, and the sweetness of your Voice, do make me partial, or else the Song is very good:

I like the Authority it carries with it, for I am usually well pleased when I hear those Songs, which attribute so much power to our Sex; but prethee tell me, why is a Souldier the aim of it? when I have heard you say, that a Souldier should be your last choice, because they are always abroad, and therefore very seldom enjoy'd after Marriage, and while they are Suitors their Pride makes them the most trou∣blesome, and the most inconstant of a∣ny; when they pay a visit, if there be a Glass in the Room, they look more on themselves, than on her they came to see, and as often as they look on their Scarf and Feather, their Vanity puffs them up so, that if we yield not imme∣diately, they Swear and Curse, and so fall off, taking it as an unpardonable af∣front that we don't admire them at first sight; and when they are beloved, their Self-conceit makes them place it to the account of their own Merits, and so they value our Love the less, because they think it their due; nay, and are not contented with a single Conquest, be it ever so fine a one, and as they do not fight for Malice, so neither do they court for Love, but out of the pure vain∣glory of Conquering; and take as much Pride in having abundance of Mistresses, as abundance of Soldiers to follow them. You observe right (said she who was called Marinda) I'le grant to you, that for these considerations, they are both the worst of Servants, and worst of Husbands, and yet in a brave Soul∣dier there is something so Noble, I mean in, his not fearing dangers, and his patient endurance of all manner of hard∣ships, that were it not for the aforemen∣tion'd inconveniencies of Absence, Pride, and Inconstancy, I should have a greater value for such a one, than ever I yet had for any other Employment:

Nay, now Marinda (reply'd the other) you make good the Character which our Sex bears among the Men, of being inconstant as the Wind; for 'twas but two or three days ago you were of a clear contrary Opinion, and you knew the same quali∣ties of Courage and Hardiness to be then in a Souldier which you do now, and therefore they are no just reasons why you should alter your mind; they make some shew of being Arguments indeed, but I have observed that Wits, when they alter their Opinions, whether it be in point of Religion, Allegiance, or any thing else, never want something to say in their own defence:

Well, since you are so desirous (said Marinda) to know the cause of this alteration of humour in me, I'll tell it you; though in doing so, I rather follow the dictates of Friendship than Discretion, and prove kinder to you than to my self, in telling you that which I am almost ashamed to think of. You know that about three or four days ago a Party of Foreigners made their entrance into this Town, with the Prince of S—g at the head of them, Curiosity made me open my Window to see them pass by, either the desire of looking about him, or the pride of being gazed at, made the Prince ride slower by that place than ordinary, and he had his design, for I looked as stedfastly on him, as if he had been the only Pageant there; and tho', without doubt, there were several Offi∣cers very brave and fine; yet the seeing him first had so prejudiced me in favour of him, that I could not think the rest worth the looking on; all the rest of that day I could not forbear thinking of him, fancying I saw with what a Grace he sat his Horse, how stately he look'd, so far beyond the rest of his Souldiers, as if na∣ture, as well as Fortune, had marked him out for a Prince and distinguished him from the rest, as much by his person, as by his power; and as the thoughts of the day have an effect upon those at night, so I believe these were the cause of my be∣ing disturbed in my Bed with this Dream. The Prince, methought, in my absence, had hidden himself in my Bed-chamber, and, when I came in, started out upon me:

He had on one side of him a little wing'd Archer, who bent his Bow, and aimed at me several times; but just by me there started up a great Gigantick form, with no other Arms but a Shield, and he, methought, still interposed that, and with it kept off the Arrows of the other; at length, methought, the Prince spoke something which tempted my De∣fender over to his side, and left me to the Mercy of the young Archer, who shot me through and through; and at the same instant the Prince came and catched me in his Arms, and told me I was his Prisoner, at which, methought, I swooned away with a pleasing pain, and at the fright of it I awaked. People say Dreams are significant, if they are, tell me what you think is the meaning of this? Why truly, (said the other) any one who should hear you tell this, might guess, without any great skill in For∣tune-telling, that you are in Love:

If (said Marinda) I did think a little the day before upon the Prince, which might have been the cause (as you say) of this Dream, yet those thoughts were too slightly grounded to be of any long con∣tinuance, and I was in hopes in a day or two to have clearly rooted them out; and the next Afternoon one of my Acquain∣tance came to desire my Company to a Ball, I was ready enough to accept of the proffer, because I imagined that the Musick and the Company would cure me of my thoughtfulness; but (as my ill Fate would have it) it was clear contra∣ry; for whom should I meet at the Ball but the Prince; you were there, and saw how I was clearly put out of my Dance, with the confusion his presence put me in:

He sate down with me, and made me some few Compliments, which tho', perhaps, were coveted by some of the Company, yet had those Ladies seen my inside, as well as they did my outside, they would rather have pitied, than envied me; 'twas he that sung under my Win∣dow last night, and though you mistook him for your Servant, yet I knew his de∣luding Voice too well:

His words were so pathetical, and the Tune so moving, that though he had skill enough at the Guittar, which he plaid on, yet that kept not time with his Voice truer than my Pulse and Heart did. Have a care Marinda (said the other) that you do not engage too far with one who is so much above you; 'tis not safe Intriguing with Persons of his Quality; Inferiour Lovers may be jested with as long as we please, and thrown off at will, but such as he seldom leave us without carrying away our Vertue, or at least our Repu∣tation:

And you will too late curse your own Charms when they have exposed you to be ruined (like a young Conjurer) by raising a Spirit which you are not able to lay. I fear (reply'd Marinda) he has spy'd something in my behaviour that (he fancied) favoured him, as Mens conceitedness makes them too apt to dis∣cover such things; I am sorry for it, if I did discover any weakness in my self, that should encourage him to such an at∣tempt:

I am sure my Tongue never dropt the least word in his favour; and if my tell-tale Eyes, or my Counte∣nance has betray'd me, I'll disfigure this Countenance, and tear out these Eyes, rather than they shall invite, or assist a∣ny enterprize, to the prejudice of my Vertue. Now though I have told the Reader the discourse these Ladies had in private, yet let him not expect that I shall tell him the Prince's thoughts up∣on it; that I should not be able to do, though I had been in his heart, for they were so different, that he scarce knew what to make of them himself:

He cer∣tainly had need of a great presence of mind, to resolve upon such a sudden what to do, whether to discover himself, or no:

If he did, he saw some probabili∣ty that the Lady might be kinder, when she knew that he had heard her confes∣sing a Love for him; if he did not in∣terrupt them, he thought he might hear more; but while he was in this irresolu∣tion he chanced to Sneeze, at which the Ladies arose from the seat which they were on by the Well, and walked away, very likely because they found some bo∣dy was nearer than they had imagined, and were afraid of being over-heard in their discourse:

The Prince lay a while mu∣sing on what he had heard, and then went home; he related it all to Celadon, and asked his advice what use he should make of it: Celadon told him it was not the safest way to extort a confession of Love from her, by letting her know he had over-heard her, be∣cause that might make her angry at his hearkening, and such a discovery might be too violent for a Maiden Mo∣desty, and so nice a one as hers seemed to be; he desired him rather to continue his Addresses, and so bring her by de∣grees to a voluntary submission; that this was the more natural and the surer way; that twice or thrice more being in her Company would ensure his Conquest over her; and what need was there to hazard her displeasure, by forcing her to confess she loved him, when he was well enough satisfied of it already? The Prince consented to this, and con∣trived this way to see her; he knew the Town was so full of Souldiers, that eve∣ry House had some of them in it, he thought hers quartered some Officers, and enquiring out who they were, he told Celadon that he would go and see them at their Lodgings:

That Evening they went together to the House, and a Maid shewing them into the Parlour, they found there Marinda and two Strangers, one of which the Prince knew to be the same he had seen at the Well with her; they would have left the Room when they saw the Prince come in, but he was too well skill'd in War to let a weak E∣nemy retreat, he had not sought her out to let her go so easily; he was thinking of some shift to put off the Officers, whom the Maid was gone to call, when to his great satisfaction she brought him word, they were not at home:

He said, that having so pleasing Company, he could very well stay till they came in, and sit∣ting down, he made a sign to Celadon to entertain the Strangers, to give him the greater freedom with Marinda, and that he had not long, for the Mother came in:

Then she (as old Women usually do) took up most of the talk her self, till the Prince, tired with it, took his leave:

As they walked home, Celadon asked the Prince what he thought of Marinda. I take her, (said the Prince) to be the most perfect Innocence that ever was since the fall of Eve: Her words are so Witty, and yet so modest, her humour so nicely Vertuous, and yet so Civil, that I account the Country Ignorance which is in her, to be beyond all the breeding in the World. I told her that I made an advantagious exchange in getting her Company, by their not being within whom I came to see; she said, she was not of the same opinion, since if Men in general were as good Company as I, she must needs blame the unkindness of Na∣ture, which had made her of so unsociable a Sex, that she was neither Wit enough to converse with Men, nor would the Rules of Vertue give a Maid that liber∣ty, if she were otherwise qualified for it:

I told her that all who knew her but so much as I did, must needs contradict her, in that Nature had given her Wit as well as Beauty; that the one was made to delight the Ears of Men, the other their Eyes; and as without always clo∣setting her self up, she could not bar us from the last, so neither, without great injustice, could she deprive us of the one half of our happiness, by tying her self up to an obstinate silence, meerly to de∣prive us of the other. She smiled, and said, she had not power enough over her self, to observe that silence which a Maid ought; but that since Men, by their in∣sinuating discourse, drew words from her which she should keep in, she would shun the Company of that deluding Sex, and so keep her self from yielding so much to them, by not coming within reach of the temptation:

She blushed as she spoke these words, and I might have gained ground mightily on her yielding heart, if the old Gentlewoman had not unfortunately come in to her rescue. The prince pleased himself much with the thoughts of his Conquest, but he knew not what a stubborn Enemy Vertue is, and how difficult it would be for him to take any advantage over a Heart, which that maintain'd against him. Ha∣ving found so little resistance at his first visit, he believed Celadon's observation was true, that two or three more would win her; he went often, under pretence of seeing the Officers, and sometimes met with them, but never with Marinda; once or twice the Servants said she was abroad, but the last time he enquired for her, they said she was sick; he fancied that she had ordered the Servants to de∣ny her, and therefore judged the readi∣est way to see her would be by his for∣mer Stratagem, a Ball; and that he might not be expected there, he gave out the Evening before, that he was go∣ing for Dublin the next day to get Or∣ders from the King:

He rode through the Town that Morning, and her House be∣ing in the way, he called at the Door, and asked to speak with one of the Offi∣cers that lodged there, but to the intent that she might take notice where he was going:

When he was out of sight of the Town, he rode back again to his Lodg∣ings another way, keeping close, that no body might know of his return; and when he thought the Ball was at the highest, he and Celadon went there toge∣ther; the place where they Danced was the same where the first Ball was, the Company almost the same, only that it wanted the Beautiful Marinda, but in wanting her it wanted all, nothing there was worthy to entertain our Prince, there∣fore he called to Celadon to go with him home; but Celadon was of another mind, he was not so nice in his choice, to retire himself from such variety of good Com∣pany, meerly for the absence of one; he was very little pleased with the caprici∣ousness of the Prince's humour, and would have willingly staid behind, if he had thought it would not disoblige him:

But the Prince being desirous to go, they took leave of the Company, and were going out together, when, at the Door, they were met by a couple of Ladies in a strange Spanish dress; and their Faces, after the mode of that Nation, had long Vails over them: Celadon bobb'd the Prince, and desired him to come back to see what Masks those were, telling him, that under them he might chance to find Marinda; the Prince was in hopes of it too, and made up to them, but found himself deceived; for speaking to one of them in French, she seemed not to understand him, but whispered to the other, and she spoke to him in Spanish, asking him whether he was not the Prince of S—g, Commander of the Forces now in Town? The Prince answer'd her that he was; but desired her if she could speak any other language to do it, for he understood very little of that. I speak, Sir, (said she) a little English, and if your Highness can understand me better in that, I shall beg the honour of a hearing from you, for I do not know but it may lye in your Highness power to do me a great kindness:

What is that kindness, pretty Petitioner (said Cela∣don) for all your excellent counterfei∣ting (Madam) I fancy you are two of this Town, that pretend some sober busi∣ness with us now, and design to laugh at us when ye are gone, for being so little curious, as to see nothing of a La∣dy but her dress. That you may not think (said the other Lady in broken Eng∣lish) that we are not of this Countrey, we'll dance you a Sarabrand after the Spanish way, and if that will not convince you, I can shew you so ugly a Face, that mine shall be the last Veil you shall ever desire to look under:

Let us have the Dance (said Celadon) and if your Air and Meen be as becoming as your Shape, I shall venture to look in your Faces, for all your threatning. The Company left off Dancing to look at these two, whose dress seem'd so extraordinary, and the Prince, who had a mind to see them Dance, ordered the Musick to play such a Tune as pleased them best, and they with their Castinets acquitted them∣selves very gracefully, and came off with the commendation of all the Company:

Their Shapes and Carriage being very near alike, Celadon did not know which to like best of them; he told them that now he must desire to see their Faces, that the handsomest might take him all to her self, and free him from the dou∣ble Captivity he now lay under, of be∣ing a Slave to them both; but one of them told him they could not grant it, for she had a boon to the Prince, in the begging of which she must open such private passages of her Life, as would make her ashamed to be seen by the Man that knew them; but if it e're lay in the Prince's power to grant her it, then she would turn English Woman, and throw off her Veil. The Prince said that was a very plausible excuse, and desired Ce∣ladon to urge the Strangers no more, and turning to them, told them, that whomsoever that Story concerned, he desired she would tell him, and he would, according to her directions, serve her to the utmost of his power. Both the Strangers gave him a very low Courte∣sie, in token of their thankfulness; and one of them desiring the patience of his Highness, and the rest of the Company, seating her self in the midst of them who had left their dancing to listen to her, she began thus,
The Story of Faniaca.

PErhaps this Company, and more particularly that part of it which is of my own Sex, may censure this free∣dom in me, and think it too much o∣penness in a Maid, to discover things of such privacy in a publick audience, which the rest of Woman-kind make their Closet-secrets; but my Spanish Mistress, upon this very occasion, told me a Story of a Spartan Boy, who having stolen a young Fox, and hidden him under his Gown, rather than be discovered, kept him there till he tore out his Bowels:

So it is with the English Ladies, if once Love enters into their Breasts, though, like that Fox, it prey upon their Hearts, yet out of Modesty they keep it secret; and though the closer it is hid, it gnaws the fiercer, yet, like the poor proud Boy, they hug it to 'em, and conceal it till it ruins them:

But the Spaniards, and those of my Country, who are in a hotter Clime, tye not themselves up to such cold, such rigid Rules of Honour:

Your Love, like your Winter Sun, is so clouded, that those he should shine on are never the better for him; ours is so hot and predominant, that there is no∣thing can cover him:

Now you your selves cannot give a good reason for this nice piece of Modesty, which allows you to take a fancy to a fine Dog, a fine Horse, or any thing else that is handsome, only Man, which is the stateliest, gayest Creature of all, you must not own a re∣gard for:

Sure this Tyrannical custom was founded at first by some old decre∣pid Matrons, that were past the enjoy∣ment of Love themselves; for Nature, that has allowed you the publick free∣dom of all other pleasures of life, would never consent to disgrace this sweetest of all:

Whence comes it then, that tho' most of you are fond of it, yet you ma∣nage it so secretly, as if it were Treason to our Sex to own it? While I am in England I should dissemble, like the Eng∣lish; but pardon me for once, if I break this general rule, in searching for a Lo∣ver, whom I can never find, but by dis∣covering my self wherever I come, that some of those who hear me, may chance to bring the same story to his Ears, that so he may find me again. My Name is Faniaca, my Father was a Brachman, an Indian Priest in the Province of Antis, which Countrey having never been con∣quered by the Incas, kept up the ancient Barbarity, not being Civilized by their Laws, as those Nations were, who had yielded to their Government:

And whereas they with one consent worship∣ped the Sun, we of Antis had several Deities, the two chief of which were the Tyger, and a large Serpent, which we called Amaru: To these it was our custom to sacrifice Human Blood; they commonly fed on nothing else but Cap∣tives, and if we had no Captives, we were forced to find them the same sort of Food from among our selves:

But we rarely found any such want, for there being an irreconcileable Enmity, first between us and the Incas, and then with those Indians who took part with the Spaniards, we had so frequent En∣gagements, they to extend their Domi∣nions, and we to defend our own, that scarce a day happened, but brought us in some new Prisoners; for the Spaniards had a great Colony at Cozco, and from thence they every now and then sent Parties far into our Countrey to take Booties, and make discoveries of the Land, in order to a farther Conquest:

These Parties were commonly made up of Indians, with Spaniards to head them, because they would willingly spare their own Nation, and Conquer ours at the Natives expence. These Spaniards still encroached farther on us, till they had driven us over the Madalena, that great River, being very deep, of a strong swift Current, and at that place about a League broad, made it seem as if our differences were now at an end, Nature it self having divided us:

On each side of the River there was a considerable Town, of which, the one was possessed by their Party, the other by ours; and though sometimes our Fishermen would meet by chance and kill, or take one ano∣ther, yet we never gave one another a troublesome visit on shore, by reason that our Canoes were not big enough to trans∣port Men in so great numbers, as to dare to Land; and it being about 300 Leagues down the Sea, we never had seen, or could imagine any which should hold above ten or twelve men at most; for our Canoes were made all of a piece, and how to put different Planks toge∣ther, as Ship-Carpenters do, was an Art wholly unknown to us:

Some of the Spaniards had taught our Enemies this, and they privately built a great many large Flat-bottoms, which the Gover∣nour of their Town fill'd with Indians, and sent a few of his own Countrey-men with them; these Forces he sent over about Mid-night, with orders to Land at our Town, kill all the Men, and send∣ing back the Boats, to keep the Town till he Landed an Army sufficient to fight his way farther into the Country. In this Town my Father lived, and was Priest to the Tiger and an Amanu, which were accounted the largest of any there∣abouts, and therefore were worshipped the most, and had their Adorers to bring them presents from all parts. Those Indians who took the Spaniards part, were always very inveterate a∣gainst us, because the Incas made both their Government and Religion diffe∣rent from ours; as soon therefore as they entered the Town they kill'd all, without any distinction either of Sex or Age; I was awakened out of my sleep with a dreadful cry, such as you may imagine that of a taken City to be, where their Enemies are so unmerciful:

I streight leapt off my Quilt, and ran into my Father's Room, for when by the cry I knew our Enemies to be entered, I expected to lose my Life, and therefore chose to lay it down by him who gave it me:

I found him in a great Conster∣nation, and hanging about his Neck, I expected the coming of our Enemies▪ The first who entered the Room was a Spaniard; for though I had never seen one before, I knew him to be one by his Dress, and a Helmet which he had on as soon as he entered, I left my Father, and fell at his Feet to beg both our Lives; and while I was in that posture, he bade his Souldiers stay back; but one of them cryed out, This is the Cupay, (that is the Devil, or Conjurer) and advan∣cing before the rest, ran at my Father with his Spear; the Commander imme∣diately broke out of my Arms, which were clasped about his Knees, and, draw¦ing a Pistol from under his Girdle, shot the Indian dead; and pulling out the o∣ther, he turned about to his Men, and swore that the first who disobeyed his Orders, as that Dog had done, he'd teach him what was the Discipline of a Souldier:

While they stood all silent, a∣mazed at the speedy Justice he had done on their Country-man, he came to me, who was lying on the Ground bemoaning my Father, whose Blood stained the Floor, he raised me from the Ground, and clapping a Guard of Souldiers on me, (with orders to keep us two from receiving any violence, upon pain of their Lives) he went away, I suppose, to help his Part'ners to take the other parts of the Town:

Within an hour af∣ter he came back, and pulling a Box out of his Pocket, he took a Plaister out of it, and put it on my Father's wound, and bad me fear nothing; assuring me, that he did not come to destroy us, but to reduce us to a better Government; and as for me, he told me, that if I pleased, he would make me so happy, that I need not fear any danger, either of Poverty, or Captivity, from the al∣teration of my condition:

This, and the approach of day-light, did somewhat comfort me; my Father came to him∣self (for loss of blood had made him swoon) and began in the kindest words he could, to give thanks to the preserver of his Life, who was hugging and com∣forting me, when of a sudden we heard the same confused noise in the Streets, which we heard in the Night:

I thought our Enemies were finishing their Cruel∣ties upon their Captives, and could not forbear bursting into Tears at their Mi∣series:

The strange Commander endea∣voured to comfort me all that he could, saying, That he could not help what the other Captains did to their Prisoners, but his own, and particularly my Father and I, should have no violence offered us:

The noise grew louder and louder, as it drew nearer, when looking out of the Window, we perceived the Antian party driving the Peruvians before them, and be∣fore he could resolve what to do, they were killing his own Souldiers at the Door; he with a great deal of Courage leaped forward, and after all his men were kill'd defended the Door alone; and with his Spear laid the boldest of them dead at his Feet:

You will, perhaps, think that I was glad of this change of my Condition, to see my self unexpectedly freed, and my Coun∣trymen revenged of their Enemies; but I'll assure you I was not; the danger which my generous Defender was in, weighed down all the Joy of the other, and though my fear made me for a while stand, as far as I could from the Weapons; yet, at last my desire to save him, overcame my Cowardise, and run∣ning to the door, I placed my self be∣twixt him and the Spears, which were bent against him; and cryed to my Father to speak to them to let him alone, my Fa∣ther was so weak with the loss of Blood, that he could not come to the Door, but called to them with all the entreating words he could think on; most of them knew my Father and me, and having a great Veneration for us (as all our Nati∣on has for their Priests) they gave over assaulting him:

Only the foremost of them asked me, why I would defend one who was the Enemy both of our Coun∣try and Religion; I told them 'twas to him, that both their Priest and I owed our safety; that he kill'd the Man who hurt my Father, and with a great deal of care dressed his Wound; I desired therefore that, for our sakes, they would give me his Life:

These words per∣swaded them to leave him to me; as soon as they were gone, I went out to see how things went, and brought him word, that a great Party from the Moun∣tains, was come to our assistance, and that all who set foot on our Land were killed:

And, Madam (said he) shall I be the only man who goes home, and carries the news of so great a defeat? Or shall it be said, that ever a Spaniard let a Woman beg his Life of an Indian?

Not of one Indian (said I) for you were over-powered by numbers:

No one but you (said he) should have given Astolfo his Life; but since I receive it from you, I'll make that use of it I should by serving you, and re∣venging my self of my Enemies, for this loss and disgrace I have suffered.

I told him, that since he confessed his Life was mine, and that I had preserved it, it was not generous to use that Life against my Country; however, I left him to his liberty, and promised him, that at Night I would send him over in a Ca∣noe to the other side:

When Night came, I was as good as my word; and calling two trusty Men, I ordered them to row the Stranger over the River, tel∣ling them that his presence would be e∣nough to secure them from the danger of their Enemies:

At our parting he ex∣pressed himself very thankful to me for my generous usage of him, and told me, that e're long he would make me a re∣turn, in the mean he desired me to wear that about my Neck, pulling a Gold Medal, with a Chain of the same Me∣tal:

I, who had heard of the Spanish Co∣vetousness, gave him a large Golden Wedge, and desiring him never to be my Country's Enemy, or put himself in∣to the like danger) I took my leave, and left him to his Fortune, the Men came back before morning, and brought me word that they had set him safe on shore, and that all the other side of the River was covered with Men:

This news, which they told about the Town, alarm'd us, and that Party which came down from the Mountains to our assistance, waited to receive them; some of our Scouts, who rowed as near the other side as they durst, brought us word that they had a∣bundance of Canoes fill'd with Men, which made us think they design'd to Land by force, where the others had by Night; but this was but to amuse and draw our Men that way; for they had provided a great number of Planks a∣bout 20 mile higher, and having light∣ed on a place where the River ran be∣tween two Hills, and therefore could not extend it self a quarter of a Mile, they made a floating Bridge, and on that they passed over some Men, before ours knew any thing of it; they took such care to surprize the Natives, that no one came to bring us Intelligence of their being Landed, till some of the Planks which came floating down the River, made us suspect something; we sent some Scouts up the River, to disco∣ver what was the matter, and they brought word that the Enmy was on this side of the River:

Ours marched to∣wards them as fast as they could to fight them, before any more came over, and having joyned Battel, the first news we heard, was of a great Victory, we had gained over them; and a great many Prisoners brought us, as the proof of its being true:

The Indian Prisoners were kept up to feed our Gods; but some few Spaniards that were taken, as being the Nobler Captives, were to be feasted on; as it was our Custom to tye our choice Prisoners to a Tree, and a great Fire being made just by, the Priest was to cut off Slices from the more fleshy parts of them, and distribute them a∣bout to the People to broil and eat:

If the Captive shewed any signs of pain, or groaned at his Sufferings, we counted him of a base Spirit; and after burning his Body, we scattered his Ashes in the Wind; but if he endured bravely to see his Flesh eaten, we dryed the Sinews and Bones, and hanging them upon the Mountains, we deify'd them, and went Pilgrimages to them. There were ten Spaniards brought to my Father, and two or 300 Indians, who were all tyed, and secured by a Guard set over them; the Indians to be a Prey to the Bellies of our Gods, and the Spaniards, to those of our Souldiers:

As soon as they were brought in, my Curiosity prompted me to see them, but very little to my satis∣faction; for the first I set my Eyes on was he whom I had set at liberty before:

I was both concerned and ama∣zed to see him there, and uncertain whe∣ther I should do any thing in his favour or no; therefore I pretended not to know him; till he making as low a bow as his being tyed would permit, asked me, did I not know him whose Life I had saved?

Are you he, said I, whom I set free but a few days ago? I thought your good usage might have made you our Friend, or at least your dangerous 
escape might have been a fair warning to you; but since you are the second time come amongst our Enemies, and are still plotting my destruction, you shall suffer for your ingratitude, and to shew how little I pity you, I will go to see you Sacrificed, and eat the first bit of you my self.

As for the danger of coming again (answered he) a Spaniard fears none, but I was so far from plotting your destrustion, that I hung that Medal about your Neck for my Souldiers to know you by; I had indeed a design upon your Countrey; but for you, my greatest desire was, by saving you and your Family, to shew how much I aimed to ingratiate my self into your favour.

These are all but Whee∣dles (said I) to save your Life; but they shall not serve:

No, they shall not (said he) for since you can entertain such mean thoughts as these of me, I scorn to take my Life; all the repentance my attempt has brought upon me is, that it has displeased you; I thought to have requited you for giving me liberty, and to have made you amends for the loss of your Coun∣try, by bringing you to a better, but since this ill success has prevented me, 
all that I desire, is to dye in your fa∣vour:

The way to do that (reply'd I) is to dye undaunted, for then you shall be one of our Gods:

I will do so (said he) be you there, and shew but the least sign of pity at my death, and I'll go off with such a Courage, that him whom you slighted whilst he was alive, you shall adore when he is dead.

Though in a Man's mouth who was at liberty, this would have looked like a Boast, yet coming from one who did not know but he might suffer next day, it appear'd so brave, that I could not but admire it:

The others held their Tongues, but looked so fierce, as if they kept si∣lence out of disdain:

I went thence with a great opinion of their Courage, and a secret horrour in my self at the cruelty of our Nation, which gave brave Men such barbarous usage:

I called to mind his professing a design to save me, and carry me to a happier place; and his telling me of the thing about my Neck, for a Token to know me by, made me believe it was true; and when I consi∣dered of this, I imagined I ought to save his Life, but I could not tell how to do it without my Father's consent:

As I came into the Room where he lay ill of his Wound, there was one brought him word of the death of his only Son; who was found after the Battel among the Slain, with a Bullet lying in him:

I shewed my sorrow in all the extravagancies which our Nation commits on the like occasi∣ons; but my Father only gave a groan or two, as it were to rouze up his anger, and said, that he would comfort himself for his Son, in revenging his Death, since all his grief could never raise him to Life again:

That all the Spaniards who were in the Battel were killed, ex∣cept ten who were in his Custody, and he would sacrifice each of them, because he would be sure that his Sons Murderer should not escape; for since he was killed with a Bullet, he did not doubt but it was a Spaniard shot him. We lay all that Night awake grieving for my Brother, but the next day, when the first Fury of our grief was over, and my Father be∣gan to talk with me about our Prisoners:

Suppose, Father, (said I) the Spani∣ard who saved our Lives should be one of them?

If that should come to pass, (said my Father) he had better staid where he was, than come over to seek his Death here the second time:

But, Sir, (said I) gratitude would oblige 
us to save his Life, who saved ours first:

That we have done already (said my Father) and so we have returned his kindness; and if after so hard an escape he should be come again, he does not deserve his Life, neither would I be guilty of so much injustice to my Son and my Countrey, as to save that Man's Life, who has been the Death of the one, and has made a second attempt to be the Destruction of the other.

This arguing of my Fathers seemed so reaso∣nable, and his Indignation so just, that I could not gainsay it, and therefore said no more to him, but went back to my Prisoner, and told him, that I did intend to save him, and his Com∣panions for his sake; but that my Bro∣ther's Body being found shot, had so in∣censed my Father, that I could not pre∣vail with him to spare them; and there∣fore I told them they must prepare their Courage to dye, as soon as my Father's Wounds would suffer him to assist at the Solemnity.

Well, (says he) since I must dye, and it does not lye in your power to help it, I am sorry you told me you attempted it, for that shews so much kindness, that it makes me desirous to live:

I was willing to dye when you 
upbraided me with the begging my life, but now I can no longer be sus∣pected to flatter you out of any such hopes, since you say it is not in your power to help me; I own that my Death is no grievance to me, only as it prevents my living for you; and all that I'll now desire of you, is to let me dye the first, that I may not behold the Cruelties exercised on my Country-men.

The Love and Courage which I perceived in these words, quite altered the thoughts I had, of giving him up to my Father's resentments; and from that time I found something within me so strong on his side, that it over-ballanced the Duty I should have paid to my Fa∣ther's will, and my Brother's Blood:

I went to my Father, and told him that he who saved his Life was there, and ur∣ged to him how ingrateful we should be, if we did not restore him to his Liber∣ty; but my Father answered me with the same Arguments he had done before:

Then I endeavoured to corrupt him that was Captain of the Guard that looked to them, but he was a Blood-thirsty vio∣lent natured Man, and not only refused me, but complained to my Father, who was so angry, that I should endeavour to release so many of our worst, our most formidable Enemies, the Spaniards, that he threaten'd, the next time I attemp∣ted the like, he would have me condem∣ned to suffer with them, as the Enemy of my Country. I knew his violent temper too well to venture any farther, and gave over all hopes of saving my Prisoner:

The next morning four Indi∣ans were to be carried to our Gods to feed upon, they drew Lots for their Lives, they were blind-folded when they drew, and I held the Cistern, and decided who the Lot fell upon, and it often grieved me to doom the poor trem∣bling Slaves; my Prisoner seeing me picking out some of them for Death, told me, he longed to know when his turn would come; I told him that his must come as well as the rest; that I had incurred my Father's displeasure on his account, and left nothing undone which I thought might be for his safety, that I hoped this was all he could ex∣pect, and desired him to own before his Death that I was out of his debt; yet I had resolved with my self to keep him till the last, in hopes that before that time the Guards might be changed, or else my Father's anger might be mitiga∣ted, when most of them had been sacri∣ficed to it:

Two or three days had now past over, in which time my Father had given the Guards particular charge to beware of the Spaniards, for fear I should free them; the day come that he found himself well enough to perform the Sacrifice, and our Spaniards were brought out in the midst of their Guards, to draw Lots which of them should make our Banquet; by ill chance it fell on my Prisoner; I changed the Lot, and sen∣tenced one of the others in his stead, but not so cleverly but that my Father per∣ceived it:

The poor wretch was cut to pieces slice after slice, and lived long e∣nough to see his own Flesh broiled, and eaten by the Company; you must think this was a terrible sight to the rest, who saw by their Companion what they were to suffer. I expected to keep him the same way I had the first day, and went on the morrow with the same design, little dreaming what would happen; for my Father, who had seen me play the Jugler the day before, would hold the Pitcher himself, and the first black Lot was again drawn by my Prisoner:

Upon that the Fire was made to broil his Flesh, he was stript naked, and tyed to the Tree; he looked about him, without as much as changing Counte∣nance at his Destiny; but when he turn∣ed his Eyes towards me he blushed, I believe out of shame, to think that I should see him in that helpless conditi∣on:

Such a sight as this, which would have drawn pity even from a merciful Enemy; what effect then do you think it had upon one that loved him? Or ra∣ther, what effect had it not? I blusht and grew pale, Anger, Love, and Fear, succeeded one another; Anger at the Barbarity of my Countrey-men, Love for him, and Fear at his danger:

But just as my Father's Knife fetched Blood from the brawny part of his Arm (the place which he first began with) I was not able to bear up any longer, but fell in a swoon; which my Father percei∣ving, left him, and catched me in his Arms; but not having yet recovered strength enough to bear me up, he fell to the Ground with me, and lighting upon his Wound, rubbed the Plaisters off, and made it bleed afresh:

My Fa∣ther was immediately taken up on some of their Shoulders, and carried home, and every one said 'twas an unlucky day, and the Gods were angry, so the Sacri∣fice was deferred till the next. When I came to my self, I was very glad to see the poor Man delivered from imme∣diate death, though it cost some of my Fa∣ther's blood, but it almost distracted me, to think what a short reprieve I had for him, only till the next day; his Fate was now at its Crisis, and within twenty four hours I must either see him free, or mangled to pieces; all my for∣mer hopes lay in deferring the time till another Guard came, which perhaps I could have bribed off, or till my Fa∣ther's mind was altered; but his Anger continued still; and because he found the Captain of the Guard as violent a∣gainst the Spaniards as himself, he or∣dered him to continue in the same Post, till all the Spaniards were Sacrificed:

My poor Prisoner's Lot was come, and he to dye the next day, and I had not yet thought on any way that could prevent it:

After having wracked my Invention a great while, for a way to free him, at last I lighted on this:

There were two of my Father's Servants, whom I sent formerly to row my Prisoner over the River; I knew they wished well to him, because when he enter'd our House as an Enemy, he had saved their Lives; these two I acquainted with my design to re∣lease him:

I gave them a large Pot full of pleasant Liquor, made of our Sacred Plant the Coca, and bade them towards Night to bring that to the Guard-house, as a present from my Father:

Our Guard consisted of a hundred Men, for the preservation of the Temple, and the Treasures of it, and the Prisoners who belonged to it; so that all these things might well require the care of an hun∣dred Men:

We had near twice the num∣ber of Indian Prisoners, besides the nine Spaniards, only they were Armed, these were naked and tied:

Out of the Tem∣ple I had got Arms enough for them all, and conveyed them into a Room hard by, to be ready upon occasion; when the two Servants came with the Liquor, all the Souldiers crowded into the Guard-house, only two who stood to their Arms at the Prison Door; when the Servants saw them all engaged about the drink, they left the Guard, and came to give me notice; upon which I took some Daggers (which our Souldiers had taken from the Spaniards, and hung up in the Temple as Trophies) these I hid under my Gown, (for the Women of our Nation had thin silk Gowns to wear in the cool of the Night) and so under pretence of seeing the Prisoners, I con∣veyed these unto them:

When I came in I saw my Prisoner asleep, I cut the Cords of his Hands and Legs, and as I cut them he awaked and found himself loose; thence I went to another, and still as I loosened them I put a Dagger in their Hands:

I told them I was come to give them all Liberty, if they would shew themselves Men, and Conquer an Ene∣my whom they would find surprized, and not ready to oppose them.

And my A∣stolfo (said I) I have done all this for your sake, yet I will rather stay behind you, and undergo all the punishments that an angry Father, or incensed Town could inflict upon me, than fly with you, unless you are as wil∣ling to receive me, as I to go.

Several of the Indians wept for Joy, and the Spa∣niards, for all their Gravity, could scarce forbear it:

My Prisoner said, that he was more glad of my Love, than of the saving his Life, and would have told me abundance of the like nature, had he not been interrupted; for one of the Centinels, not liking my long stay, came to see what was the matter, and no sooner came in but he was stabb'd by one of the Spaniards; my two Servants had stood all this while at the Door, and when one of the Centinels left them to come to us, they dispatched the o∣ther; by this time the Indians had un∣tyed one another, and I carried them to a Chamber hard by, where I had laid the Arms:

Some of the Guard, hearing a noise, chanced to come out, and mi∣strusting something more than ordinary alarm'd the rest, but they came a lit∣tle of the latest, for we had as many Armed as they; they began a very bloody Engagement, and a great many were killed on both sides, but our num∣ber increasing we over-powered them, and they fled every way for safety. My Prisoner had given me in charge to some of the Indians, who were formerly un∣der his Command, and they kept me in Rear till the Guard fled:

Then Astolfo came to me, and desired me to come down to the River side, before the Town Guards came upon us, for our noise had alarm'd the Town; and there were at that time five or six thou∣sand Men which were left with us, for fear those on the other side the River should make another Invasion; but we were too quick for the uproar, before the Guards came we got to the River, and there being abundance of Canoes, and the Enemy coming after us, you may guess we did not stand to Comple∣ment who should take Boat first:

The eight Spaniards, Astolfo, the two Indians and my self, took the same Canoe:

We put off altogether as fast as we could, but in a lit∣tle time we were parted from the rest, the night being so dark that we knew not which way we went, though the Wind blew so hard from the other side, that we were afraid 'twould force us on our Enemies Coast, to our ruin:

Two of our Spaniards tugg'd against it as hard as they could, till one of them broke his Oar, and then we gave over striving, and let the Boat go down which way the River would carry it; the next mor∣ning we would have made for Shore, but having but one Oar the Wind beat us off, and carried us down all that day and the next night with the Stream. Though the first day we got away we were very chearful, yet now wanting Provisions, and being driven down we knew not whither, dampt the Joy we should otherwise have taken in our Love and Liberty:

I began to reflect on my former actions, and to think this a just punishment for my undutiful leaving my Father, and my Country; I began to grow faint with hunger, and he was so troubled to see me in that condition, that in the greatest danger of his Life I never saw him shew so much sorrow. The farther we Sailed the River still grew wider and wider; on one side we could not Land, because the Wind would not let us, on the other side we durst not, because 'twas inhabited by those Nations who are mortal Enemies to the Spaniards: We were now come down a great way, and the River had turned so, that the Wind, which before was against us, now was for us; we made towards the Land with the greatest haste that a violent Hunger could make; as we came near the Shore we discovered a Boat lying under a Rock, we made to∣wards it, and saw only one Man in it, and he was asleep, so that we were upon him before he awaked; he would have resisted, but finding it in vain for one Man to fight with eleven, he yielded up himself and his Boat; in it we found store of Victuals (the richest prize we could have wished for at that time) and you may think we fell on to some purpose:

We examined the Fellow, and he said he belonged to a Ship which lay about sixty Leagues lower; that they sent twenty Men up the River in quest of a Prize which they were to take, by plun∣dering a little Town thereabouts; he told us, that there were about so many more left in the Ship, but that the greatest part of them lay sick of the Wounds they had received in a late Engagement:

We stept into his Boat, and going down the River, in eight days time we came within sight of the Ship; then having got out of the Man what intelligence we thought ne∣cessary, we threw him over-board, and made up to the side of the Pinnace; it being duskish, and they knowing their own Boat again, they mistook us for their own Men; so that half the Spani∣ards entered, and had killed all that were above Deck, before they mistrusted any thing; the rest they took Prisoners, and (throwing all the Wounded Men into the Sea) because we had not Provisions sufficient to last us all, they set their Pri∣soners on Shore, and so came down the River merrily in a Ship of our own:

The Spaniards fell to searching, and found some Bullion in her, besides a vast deal of ready money, which, after a just division between us ten, we computed would amount to near 30000 Ducats a piece, so that with a general consent we Sail'd streight for Spain, intending to Land at the first Port of that Kingdom which we came to. Now we were happy enough, we had escaped our Enemies the Indians, and Famine, which had like to have proved a more fatal Enemy than they; besides the Prize which enriched us be∣yond our expectation, and came in good time to help my needy Fortune, who in that hurry of leaving home, had not re∣membered to bring any thing of value with me, besides a few Pearl which I al∣ways wore about me. My Servant came and took me in his Arms, congratula∣ting my escape out of the several dan∣gers we had been in, and thanking me a thousand times for the kindness I had shewed in saving his Life; and more for leaving a Father, to run the same For∣tune with him:

In fine, he promised that he would requite all my kindnesses, by having me Christened, and marrying me as soon as we came to Spain: And I was so well pleased with the alteration of my Condition so much for the better, that I think that Night was one of the pleasantest of my Life. The next Mor∣ning we spy'd a Sail making up to us, and as soon as it came within reach, it sent a great Shot to command us to strike Sail; we saw by the bulk that it was a Man of War, too strong for us to re∣sist:

We, much against our wills, staid for it, and received some of them on board; in searching our Ship they found divers Colours, as Pyrats usually have; our Vessel, it seems, had been one, and for their Faults who had owned her, we were all seiz'd, our Vessel made a Prize, and our Men taken Prisoners:

The Man of War being a Spaniard, the Captain said he would reserve Astolfo and his eight Country-men to be tryed on Shore, and condemned to the Gallies:

My two Indians (notwithstanding all my intrea∣ties for their Lives) he hanged on the Ropes before my Face:

But taking com∣passion on me, he said he would keep me to wait on his Wife:

Accordingly, when we came upon the Coasts of Spain, he sent the nine Spaniards Prisoners to Sevil; and though I begg'd him to let me accompany Astolfo, he kept me at Sea a few days more, and then Landed me at Aveiro, and gave me a present to a Wife he had there. It would be tedi∣ous for me to tell you, how ill I bore this worst change of my Fortune; I ra∣ged, I grieved, till my Sighs and Tears grew so thick upon one another, that no one could know which was the most plentiful of their two Fountains, my Heart, or my Eyes. My Mistress, who was a good natur'd Gentlewoman, in∣teressed her self in my Sorrows, and would often enquire what was the rea∣son of my grieving; till at last her Im∣portunities drew from me the whole Relation, which I have now made to you; she bade me be comforted, and think no more of him; I told her I could not be satisfied without him:

That opinion (says she) is, I hope, a false one; you must be comforted either without him, or not at all, for you must never expect to see him again; for supposing he should escape, being condemned to the Gallies, yet how is it likely that you, who are a Stranger, should find out a single Man, and one of no note, in such a large City as Sevill, or one who perhaps, before you could get thither, would be gone to some other part of the World?

I told her I had an Art, by which I could do more than that; and thus much I knew, that if I were at my liberty, and had a little travelling Money, I should not be a year e're I found him She asked what Art that was:

'Tis what I learned 
from my Father, (said I) and is very com∣mon among us:

She desired to see the effects of it; I told her I would shew it, in resolving whatever question she would ask me. She bade me tell her where her Husband was at that time, and when he would come home:

I told her she must buy me a small Drum, which had never been used before, and I would then tell her that question, and any other. When she heard me affirm it so confidently, she said she would try me, and bought me a Drum:

I that Night used some Charms over it, which my Father and I had pra∣ctised on such occasions; and the next morning I told her my Master would be at home on the morrow:

I thought (says she (laughing) how you could foretell: Why your Master is gone into the Straights a crui∣sing, and bade me not expect him these two Months.

I let her enjoy her increduli∣ty, but she had like to have suffered by it; for she, good Woman, considering that her Captain made long stays and short returns, had providently looked out for a Gallant, to comfort her in his absence; but I was yet too much a Stranger to be made acquainted with such privacies. She had an old Spanish Maid, who was the only Servant she
kept, till I came; this Maid was privy to all her Intrigues. They had at that time pitched upon a young Gentleman, who had an Estate near the City, he was very fond of my Mistress, as Men usu∣ally are of every new Conquest, and had invited her to spend a few days, in her Husband's absence, at his Countrey Seat:

She consented to go with him, and they had assigned a day to go together, and as it happened, 'twas the very day after that on which my Master was to come home; but it drawing towards Night, and my Mistress hearing no news of him, nor seeing any likelihood of his coming, she sent her Maid to invite the Gallant to Sup with her; me she sent up to Bed, pretending that she had some business for me to rise very early the next morning:

I lay in the Room over her, and though I went to Bed without the suspition of any such treachery a∣gainst my Master, yet chance discove∣red it all to me:

I awakened after I thought I had been a pretty while asleep, I fancied I heard a Man's voice in my Mistresses Chamber, and concluded it was my Master's, because I thought my Art would not deceive me; however, my curiosity prompted me to a desire of knowing whether it was he or no:

I got out of Bed softly, and looking down, I saw her sitting at Table, with three dishes of Meat before her; (which in hungry Spain is a noble Treat) by her there was seated a fine young Gentle∣man, he whom I just now described to you; their discourse, at that instant, happened to be of me. She told him she had a Slave who pretended to foretell future events; that she had told her that the Captain would be at home that day; the Gentleman laughed, as he said, to think that a Slave should be so bold, to impose such a Story on her Mi∣stress; he laughed at her too, for gi∣ving any belief to me; and I laughed at them both, to think how secure they fancied they were from my Eyes and my Masters, and yet how much they were mistaken. While I was peeping down, and listening to their discourse, we heard a loud knocking at the Door; my Mi∣stress cry'd out immediately that it was the Captain's knock, and that she was undone, unless they could hide him somewhere in that Room; for to send him up to mine, was the way to let me know of it, and being a Stranger, per∣haps I might betray him to her Husband. The Gentleman was young and slender; and his Limbs; which seemed composed rather for Love than War, shew'd that he was a very unequal Match for a great two-handed Sea Captain:

And you have all heard enough of the raging Spanish Jealousie, to think, that if a young hand∣some Man had been found there, and at so suspitious a time, 'twould have gone near to have cost all three of them their Lives. The Captain still knocking har∣der and harder, made them all at their wits end what to do with him; at length they bethought themselves of a great Chest, which my Master had given his Wife full of Plunder, when he first came on shore with me; but she had taken all those things out, and my Master had fil∣led it with Sea Bisket, which he had bought for his Men; the Mistress and Maid emptyed these Biskets out under the Bed, and begg'd the Gentleman to try whether he could get into the Chest; the young Spark was as complying as she could wish him; he made a quick shift to get in, and his Fear was at that time so strong upon him, that it would not only have driven him into that, but into a Mouse-hole, if there had been one in the Room:

As soon as he was in, the Maid let in my Master, who seemed a little angry that he was kept so long at the door; and seeing the Cloath laid, and the Table covered with Meat, he asked my Mistress how all that came there, and what she designed with it? I wondered how she would come off; but she very readily answered, that she provided it for him, and kept him at the Door while she took it from the Fire, that he might be the more surprized, to find so good a Supper ready for him on the Table. He asked how she could pro∣vide it for him, since no Man in Aveiro knew of his coming? My Mistress an∣swered, that the Indian he had left with her, had told her he would certainly be at home that night.

When did she tell you this? (said he)

Yesterday (answered my Mistress)

Then, by St. Jago, she is a Witch, (said my Master) for yesterday morning, till the Storm came, I did not know (that I should come) my self:

I hope, Captain, said my Mistress, you have re∣ceived no damage by the Storm:

None, said he, but the spoiling my store of Bisket, which got wet, and my poor Men are in want of it; but I will have you, said he (turning to a Cabbin-Boy that waited on him) go now and call two or three of our Men on 
Shore, that we may have hands enough to carry that Chest of Bisket to the Water-side:

Time enough for that to morrow, Love, (said my Mistress)

No, (says my Master) my Men are in present want of it, and I ought to take care of them, as well as of my self.

The Boy went on his Errand, and my Mistress with a great deal of pain, wai∣ted the unlucky coming of the Seamen to carry the Chest away, and her Jewel that was in it. I had till this time been an unconcern'd Spectator, and only pleased my self with the fright my Ma∣ster's coming had put them in, but now I saw I must help them out, or they had no way of their own to bring them off; dressing my self therefore as fast as I could, I went down to them; my Mi∣stress, I believe, wondred to see me there, when she thought I was asleep, yet she did take no publick notice of it, lest my being sent up to Bed, should give my Master the greater cause to sus∣pect something. After bidding my Master wellcome home, I turned to my Mistress:

And did I not tell you, Ma∣dam, (said I) that my Master would be at home to Night?

You may see, (said she) by my preparations for him, that I believed you:

I could not
forbear smiling to see how she would have imposed on me, as she did on my Master:

But, Madam, (answered I) since I have given you such a proof of my skill, which (though it has told you this only for tryals sake yet) hereafter may shew it self some way, which may prove more serviceable to you, I would desire one favour of you in its behalf:

What's that? (answered she)

'Tis (said I) that you would pardon me for an accident which befell me in the per∣formance of it:

What's that (says she) I hope you have not raised any Spirits that have broken our Windows, or done any damage to the House:

What if they have (said my Master) you shall pardon any slight mischief that they have done:

They have done no mis∣chief at all, (said I) pray do not be affrighted, Madam, and I'll tell you all:

When you were abroad yesterday I set about my Enchantment, to an∣swer your question, but you came home a little too soon, while I was asking some questions concerning my own Fortune; hearing you at the Door, and not having time to lay that Spirit which I had raised, I ordered him to throw 
the Bisket out of the Chest, and enter into it himself; you can't but have heard how mischievous Spirits are, while they are at liberty, and to pre∣venty any such mischief, I confined him there, till your absence should give me leisure to lay him:

You went soon after to Bed, and I durst not tell you how near the Spirit was to you, for fear of fright'ning you, nor would at all, had not the present use my Master has of the Chest, forced me to this discovery:

When my Mi∣stress heard this told, she ran to my Ma∣ster, and clasping him about the mid∣dle, pretended to be in the greatest fright imaginable; and desired him to leave me the House to my self, till I had ridded the house of the Devil. Though the hot Supper, which my Master be∣lieved prepared for him, and my Mi∣stress saying, that 'twas because I fore∣told his coming, had confirmed him in the belief of my Art; and the earnest∣ness with which I begg'd pardon, made him not question what I said to be true; yet he laughed at the extream fear, which his Wife so excellently counterfeited, and said,

Never fear, Wife, that Mr. Devil, who has been so civil as to lye 
there all last night, will be so rude, as to disturb us now: Sure, Faniaca, he he will not force us to leave our Victu∣als to cool, to dance attendance on him: If he will give us leave to Sup, we will retire afterwards, and give you leisure to dismiss him:

Not for the World, (said my Mistress) I cannot eat one bit, nor enjoy my self one mi∣nute, while the Devil is so near us; dear Love, consider the danger 'tis to be here, and let us go to some Neigh∣bours, and leave the Witch and the Devil together:

Since you are so fear∣ful (said my Master) have but patience, till my Men come, and I'll order them to carry the Chest up Stairs, for I am loath to leave this hot Supper; but do not shew your fear to them, for if they know that his Devilship is in it, 'tis likely they won't venture to meddle with it.

My Mistress said, she thought it long till they came; and I dare swear she did not counterfeit in that, but was at that time as desirous to get rid of her inclosed Spark, as ever she was to get into his Company:

The Sea-men kept her not long in pain, for they came while we were talking of them:

My Master mentioned nothing of the Bisket to them, but desired, before he sat down, that they would remove that Chest up one pair of Stairs for him:

Two of them immediately laid hold on two Rings which were fastened in the sides of it, and heaved it by degrees up stairs, I lighting them the way; the Stairs were so narrow that they could not go both on a breast, but one pulled the Chest up, and the other heav'd it after him, by which means our Gallant was almost stifled in it, for his Head chanced to lie at that end which was lowermost; therefore, when it was near the top, he not being able to endure it any longer, stirred about to lye easier, and coughed; at which the Men, being startled, let go, and the weight of the Chest tumbled it down that pair of Stairs, and another pair which joined just to it; though the Chest was locked, yet the tumbling of it made me expect every moment that it would sly open; and therefore, lest it should discover the Gentleman, I dropt the Candle:

My Mistress shriek'd at the noise, and clapt too the Room Door where my Master was; he stood silent, not knowing what to think of the noise; one of the Sea∣men stood by me till the Maid brought us a light, but the other, who bore up the lower end of the Chest, was driven down all the Stairs before it:

I heard the poor Man groan, and was terribly afraid that it was the Gentleman's voice, and that the fall had crippled him; I therefore desired them all to stay in the Room while I went down Stairs, they were willing to obey me, for the horrid noise had put them in such a Fright, that they stood gazing one at another, wondering what the event would be:

When I came down, I found the Chest open, and the Gentleman gone; then I helped the hurt Man up Stairs; his Head was broken, and some parts of his Body bruised with the fall, but he was more afraid than hurt.

Well, said my Mistress to me, this comes of your raising the Devil.

The Seaman, who did not know what to make of it before, hearing her say it was the Devil, concluded it was so indeed; and said, He was sure 'twas a cloven Foot trod on him, for he felt it, and that he saw the Tail of it, as it went out of the House.

What, then is he gone (said my Mistress)

Yes, Madam, he is gone (said I) and shall trouble you no more:

A good riddance (said she) of your Mischie∣vous 
Spirits, pray raise no more of them:

Then, Madam, (said I) you must not give me the occasion.

Now my Mistress's real fear was over, her counterfeit one vanished with it, and bidding us set Chairs, she and my Ma∣ster sat down; the wounded Man he sent on Ship-board to the Chyrurgeon, and having supped and diverted himself with the poor imprisoned Devil, they went to Bed, where he passed that night with my Mistress, who would rather have had that Devil for her Bedfellow. The next morning my Mistress's Con∣fessour came to her; and my Master, who was filled with the last nights ad∣venture, could not contain himself from communicating it to the Father, saying, That he had given his Wife an Indian, that could raise Spirits, and make them tell her things that were do∣ing at ever so great a distance; rela∣ting, withall, what had happened by that means in his House the night before:

The Holy Man, stroking up his Beard, with an austere look, told him, that this was no Jest, said, it was making a compact with the Devil, and that his Christianity obliged him to confess him∣self an Enemy to all such actions; and therefore was bound in Conscience to discover this to the Fathers of the Inqui∣sition; and desired my Master to secure me:

He said this when I was by; I was earnest to know what he meant by the Inquisition; but when he told me the danger of coming under the clutches of that bloody Court, and named some of their Punishments, as the Wheel, Im∣muring, and other ingenious Cruelties of theirs, I would have given my life for a Maravedy. When my Master was gone out, I fell down on my knees to my Mistress, and begg'd her to give me my liberty, and put me in some way to escape this barbarous tryal, that the Priest would bring me to:

I told her I was loath to mention the kindness I had done her, in conveying her Spark away, lest that should look like upbraiding her with it; but thus much I must say of it, that it was that Story which made the Priest so zealous against me, and that if ever I came before the Inquisition, Self-preservation would force the truth from me, and that I must confess the Cheat I put upon my Master, to avoid the imputation of Witchcraft. See an∣swered me very civilly, that she had such a sense of the kindness I had done her, that she would requite it with giving me my freedom; and when my Master came home, she was very urgent till she prevailed with him to do the like; whe∣ther she did this out of gratitude to me, or the fear of my threatning a discovery, I do not know; but my Master called me to him, and bade me go and hide my self on board that night, lest the Officers should come to search for me:

The next day he came on board him∣self, and asked me where I would ra∣ther Land, I told him in England; for I had consulted my Drum, and was in∣formed, that I should find my Lover in one of the Northern Islands, coming from the Siege of a City, and the Ru∣mour of the Hollanders just then Landing in England, made me think that likely to be the place:

We met at Sea with an English Merchant, and giving me a lit∣tle Money, he put me on board there; I had, besides, some Money my Mistress gave me at parting, and a Pearl Neck∣lace, with some Bracelets, which my Master (finding so great a Prize with us) spared me, when he plundered me at Sea; these sold in England for two hun∣dred Duckets; with some of this Mo∣ney I put my self into an English Garb, keeping my Spanish one by me, and went up to London, and hired my self to a Person of Quality; and being an Out∣landish Woman, and appearing in a ve∣ry gentile Dress, I was made her Gen∣tlewoman; I staid with her near a year, in which time I put up a little more Money, and good Cloaths, and learn'd English enough, and then I left her, to travel in quest of my Lover:

I went down to Chester, and hearing that there was a War in Ireland, I embarked for this Kingdom; I have been in Dublin, and am now come hither to follow the Camp, where I am assured I shall find him:

I get as much as maintains me on the Road, by telling Fortunes to the Gentry, who sometimes are very liberal to me:

Amongst the different Fates I read, those belonging to Love delight me most, as being most agreeable to my own temper; and when ever it lies in my way to forward any of those by my Skill, my being in their Circumstances, makes me the readier to help them.

She ended thus, to the admiration of all the Company, whose Ears were tyed to the Story; The Prince, who was pleas'd with the Wit of the Indian, could not deny her those praises that were due to it; and from her ingenuity in the ma∣nagement of her intrigue, and her con∣stancy in continuing it so long, he con∣cluded that the Spaniard must needs be happy in her; and told her, that if he was in the Army, whether he were in Commission, or a private Souldier, he would do what lay in his power to con∣tribute to the finding him out for her, But, he said, he expected a kindness of her in retaliation, and that if he search∣ed for her Lover, she would (if need were) do him the same service; that he never gave any credit to Gypsies, or a∣ny other Vagabonds that pretended to her Talent, but since she had proved her Skill in so exemplary a manner, he would lay aside his former incredulity, and de∣sire she would satisfy his Curiosity in some things, which it would conduce to his quiet to know. The Indian said, she would wait on his Highness, at his Lodg∣ings, the next day, and give him what satisfaction her Art could afford him. But he was not the only Person that wan∣ted her assistance, neither had the ter∣rours of War so frighten'd Love, as to make him wholly abdicate his power o∣ver that Kingdom; but in this Ball he had some Votaries of both Sexes, and the ingenious Indian told publickly the place where she Lodged, that those whose Modesty restrained them from speaking to her there, might have a more private opportunity. The Prince went home well satisfied with the hopes of knowing his Fortune, and told Cela∣don that he was so impatient to see the next day, and the Indian that would sa∣tisfie his Doubts, that he found himself not the least inclinable to Sleep; there∣fore, if he would make him a Song, in answer to that, which he told him he had over-heard his Mistress singing at the Well, he would that Night go Serenade her with it; and though he could nei∣ther meet with her at the Ball, nor find her at home, yet this Song would make a discovery which might alter the reser∣vedness of her Behaviour: Celadon made one; about Midnight they sallied out to∣gether, and stopping under her Window, the Prince, with the best air which his Guittar and Voice could frame, be∣gan this Song, to the same Tune which she had Sung to hers.
THe Souldier yields his vanquish'd Heart, As Conqu'ring Beauty's prize; And though he fears no mortal Dart, The Thunder of your Frowns he flyes, And dreads the Lightning of your Eyes.

You shall dread this more, said a Voice interrupting him; the Prince looking a∣bout, to see whence the Voice came, saw three naked Swords making towards him: Celadon came up immediately to his assistance; it being so dark, that neither Party could see to defend them∣selves, there had been fair work in a small time, if some of the Guards, wal∣king the round, had not been pretty near them; when they came up, the three fled, and the Souldiers knowing the Prince, Congratulated his High∣ness's escape, from a Death, which the most unskillful Enemy might have given him, when there was not light enough to allow him fair play for his Life:

They would needs wait on him home, and he considering that the noise might have allarm'd some of the Neighbours, thought it best to retire, for fear of rai∣sing a discourse, which might prove prejudicial to his Mistress, and offend her. The next Afternoon the two Strangers came to wait on the Prince, and finding him alone, one of them told him, she was come to make good her promise, that she brought her Compa∣nion with her, who understood nothing but Spanish; however, if his Highness had any secret extraordinary to commu∣nicate to her, she would go with him to another end of the Room; the Prince opening a Closet Door, retired in thi∣ther with her, and opened his mind in these words:

Since I want such advice, as cannot rightly be given, without some fore-knowledge of what will be the issue of it, and since my business is nothing but an Amour, who so fit to consult about it as you, who are a For∣tune-teller, and a Lover too? You may understand then, that my business is nothing but Love; it is one so vio∣lent, and yet so unreasonable, that I am unable to curb it, nor have I any hopes of success, if I let it go on; and 'tis just with me now, as with a Souldi∣er, whom his too boyling Valour has engaged so far in the Battel, that his Enemies have surrounded him; there's no retreating for him, because the Foe is behind, nor any likelihood of brea∣king 
through, because there are too many before him:

So am I surrounded with difficulties, pushed forward by Love, and opposed by Despair; carri∣ed on by her Charms, and driven back by her Disdain; now I would know what my success may be, if I go on, and accordingly I will either nourish this Passion, or tear it from my Breast?

I cannot see, (said the Indian) what should discourage your Highness from proceeding, since there are those per∣fections in your Highness, which give you desert enough to pretend to the best of Women:

I fancy your Highness has fallen in Love with some one below you, and that your Love and Ambition are at variance, whether that shall draw Love up, or Love draw that down:

I know these two generally tend two contrary ways, that one, like Earth, de∣scending, the other, like Fire, still aspi∣ring upwards.

You guess as right, (said the Prince) as if you had seen my Heart; and if you can tell me how I shall succeed in my Love, I'll make that, or my Ambition, conform it self to the other:

I doat on one who is be∣neath me; when I made my first Ad∣dresses, she seemed Pliant enough, as 
if she had no aversion to my Love; nay, I over-heard her once confessing to a Confident, that she had a kindness for me; and when I thought her my own, I found my self most deceived; for some Capricio or other made her, that she would never since admit me into her Company; I went several times to enquire for her at home, but the Ser∣vant still shifted me off, either deny∣ing her, or pretending she was sick; I contrived last Night's Ball, in hopes to entice her thither, but it failed; I Serenaded her last Night with a Song, in answer to one I heard her Sing, that time she confessed a Love for me, but before it was ended, I was interrupted by some Night Adventurer, who at∣tempted to kill me, which makes me suspect 'tis some Rival; inform me by your Art, whether this is a Favourite that supplants me in her Heart, or whether it be Virgin Niceness, Hypo∣critical Modesty, or what else it is that has put this sudden stop to my Success?

This is a puzzling question (said the In∣dian) but give me one Night's time to consult my Drum about it, and I will bring you an answer.

The Prince see∣med well contented, and the two Stran∣gers,
taking their leaves of him, left him to expect the insight the next day would give him of his Fortune. On the morrow they came again, and the Prince took the Indian into the Closet (as he had done the day before) and desired her to be as plain as she could, in foretelling him all that was to befall him in his Love:

First, (said she) your Highness must acquaint me whether you design Marriage, or no. Marriage! (said the Prince) why did not I confess to you, that she was a private Gentlewoman, one beneath me? I wonder you should ask such a question:

Pray, Sir, be not angry, (reply'd the Indian) for how can I tell your Highness what success you are like to have in any design, until I know the design it self? If (answer'd he) I can enjoy her on any terms, but those of Marriage, I shall think my self very hap∣py; if not, my Love has so wholly blind∣ed me, as to make me forget my Inte∣rest, and my Honour. Your Highness (said she) is certainly very prudent, in having so great a command over your Love; and pray make use of it, when I shall tell you the state of your Affairs:

The Lady you Love, has a Gentleman who loves her as violently as you, only a more honourable way:

Your High∣ness's Fortune has altogether the ascen∣dant over his, if you are inclined to lay hold of that advantage, if not, my Art tells me, that, within a Week, she will be too far off for you to enjoy, or ever to see her again. And is this all the hopes you can give me? (said the Prince) Yes, (said she) only thus much I may add, that your Fortune promises you a great deal of happiness, if ever you have her; but if you Love, I need not tell you this, for Love injoy'd is always happy; since, if there be such a thing as happiness, it is to be in that conditi∣on which is most delightful to us; being in possession of what we Love, is being in the condition which is most delight∣ful to us, and thence may well pretend to be the highest of Enjoyments. I see you are so Indulgent (said the Prince) as to humour me in my Love, but that is destructive to me, and therefore we'll talk of it no more; there's something (said he) by way of gratification, for the trouble I have put you to:

The In∣dian told him, she would not receive a∣ny such reward, for the unwelcome news she had brought him; that all the requi∣tal she desired, was his Highness's favour to the Spaniard, if ever she found him:

Only desired his Highness to take her advice, never to put himself to the trou∣ble of another attempt on his Mistress, unless 'twas with a design of Marriage, for her Art declared it would prove un∣successful:

That if his Highness ever wanted her help in this, or any other business, he might find her in this Town, where she resolved to stay, till the Army was marched through it to Limerick, be∣cause that was the likeliest way to find out her Lover. With these words she took her leave, and taking her Compa∣nion with her, left the Prince in the greatest distraction of thought imagina∣ble:

The assurance which the Indian had given him, that he must expect no suc∣cess, unless in a Vertuous Love, made him resolve to shake off the mean Passi∣on; but all his endeavours were vain; the more he tryed it, the more sensible he grew, how unable he was to perform it:

He advised with Celadon, and they agreed to carry on the Intrigue, in spight of what the Indian foretold; and this a∣greed best with the Prince's humour, who, though he could not entertain the thoughts of Marrying her, could less en∣dure the thoughts of losing her. They contrived to have it thought about Town, that Celadon had fallen into the Prince's displeasure; the Prince shewed the first signs of it in House, and they of the House soon reported it abroad; Celadon, with a seeming discontent, left the Prince, and went to Lodge with one of the Officers, at Marinda's Mo∣ther's:

There was a young Gentlewo∣man, a Cousin of Marinda's, and her chief Confident, the same whom the Prince had heard talking with her at the Well, the only comfort of her Parents, who were worth above ten thousand Ducats, of which, their Deaths would leave her the entire Possessour; she was withal very Witty, and good Humou∣red; but Nature and Fortune, who not often agree to be over-kind to the same person, had here followed their usual Custom, making her want in Beauty, what she had in Riches:

And as her Wit was keen, and sharp, upon all that came into her Company, so Nature had given you an exact Copy of her inside, by her out-side; for her Face had as much of Satyr in it, as her Tongue; the Chin of it was sharp and long, the Nose tucked up, as if it fled from her Mouth, which was so wide, as if Nature had designed it for some Cormorant Bo∣dy:

Her Face was all over studded with Freckles, which, like the Stars in the milky way, lay so thick, that you would have thought it one con∣tinued yellowness; only her Cheeks, which had a red Colour, but such a tawny one, as that of blasted Goos∣berries. This Gentlewoman was then in Town with Marinda's Mother, who was her Aunt, and she was an excellent help to her Cousin, both diverting her from Melancholly with her Company, and helping her with her Advice:

When Celadon came to Lodge there, he became acquainted with her; and having re∣membered, that he once had some dis∣course with her, while the Prince was entertaining her Cousin, he call'd to mind, how Witty and Pleasant he that time found her Conversation:

Their be∣ing in the same House, made them often in one anothers Company, and in a lit∣tle time they grew to a great Familiari∣ty. Celadon, hearing what a considera∣ble Fortune she had, made his Addresses to her in earnest, but found her still grow strange, when he spoke to her of that, and therefore thought that some∣thing extraordinary was the cause of it: in the mean time the Prince grew recon∣ciled to Celadon, and as their falling out, was only a pretence for Celadon's leaving him to Lodge there, so the Prince now made use of that priviledge to his own advantage; for now Marinda could no longer avoid him; and though she did as often as she could, yet he came so often thither, that sometimes he lighted on her before she was aware: Celadon's Chamber was on the same floor with hers, and nothing but a small Gallery divided them; her Chamber was just at the Stair-head, and the Prince would sometimes, as he came up Stairs, find her Door open, and then force himself into her Company:

He this way had frequent access to her, yet could ne∣ver gain from her the least word in his Favour:

In this posture his Amour was, when an Express came to him, that the King had set out of Dublin, on his March to Limerick; the Prince gave the Officers notice to have all the Souldiers in Arms the next day to receive him:

He went streight to see Marinda, because he did not know but the King might take him along with him, as he came through the Town, and so not give him time to take his leave of her:

He came into her Mo∣ther's, and being used to go often thi∣ther to Celadon, went up Stairs, with∣out speaking to any body; not seeing her below, he went into her Room, but not finding here there, and seeing her Closet-door open, and a Pen and Ink on the Table, he pulled the Door close, and sat down to write a Billet Deux, which he intended to leave for her:

In the mean while Marinda came into the Room, and this Cousin with her, and sitting down, they carried on a discourse, the first words of which the Prince did not hear, but the following were to this purpose:

I tell you, Marinda, (said the Stranger) 'tis in a happy hour for you, that the King is coming down, for he will take these Souldiers with him, and this Prince, who is so ungentile to en∣deavour the ruin of a Gentlewoman:

I should scarce blame him (said Marinda) for why should a Man be blamed for pro∣secuting the way to his own happiness? Nor am I so conceited, as to aim at Mar∣riage; for what private Gentlewoman could nourish such vain hopes as those, of being raised to a Princess? 'Tis more than a bare Prodigy, for Earthquakes, Inundations, and those wonders of Na∣ture do sometimes happen; but that a Prince should marry a private Maid, is such a wonder, as I never found menti∣oned in all the Chronicles I have read. What? Cousin, (says she) and do you plead for him! will you ever consent to his Love on dishonourable terms? No, (said Marinda) as I do his Cause Ju∣stice, so I will my own; had not this news of the King's coming prevented me, I would have gone with you to your Fa∣ther's, to avoid him; now I will deferr it till I hear the Siege of Limerick is o∣ver, then I will retire to your House, or some other Relations, where he shall ne∣ver trouble me again, or I him. Ay, do, Marinda, (said her Cousin) fly the Tempter:

But what shall I do with my Lovers? They are both going to the Camp, and will expect that I give them some satisfactory answer; and I do not know which way to incline; the one is a Captain of Horse, he is appro∣ved of by my Father, but disliked by my Mother and me, because he is a Pa∣pist, and I have another cause of aversi∣on for him, that is, that he is a Foreig∣ner; I don't fear that all his Country Jealousie can make him suspitious of such a Face as mine; but those on the conti∣nent make such saucy domineering Hus∣bands, that no free-born Irish-woman will endure their slavery:

There is Ce∣ladon a good Humoured, Handsome, Witty Fellow, and one that I like very well; he makes his Courtship so zea∣lously, and swears so seriously that he Loves me, that I do almost believe him; yet the Fellow is so poor, that I fancy neither Father nor Mother will ever consent to my having him; prithee tell me what resolution to take; or whether of the two to favour, my inclination, or my Obedience. There is (said Marin∣da) come to this Town an Indian, who tells Fortunes very true:

Shall we (said she) put on our Masks, and go to her? No, (said Marinda) she will come to me for sending for; I was the first that received her in this Town, and well∣com'd her as a Stranger, and therefore she is very intimate with me:

Then pray (said the Stranger) let us send for her immediately: 'Tis not a fit time (said Marinda) but in the Afternoon I will send her a Message by my Maid, and she shall bring her with her; but we are summoned, here's a Servant come to call us to Dinner. They went down toge∣ther, and the Prince stole softly to Cela∣don's Room, and finding him within, bade him come along with him to his Lodgings; and he bearing the Prince company out, no body suspected, but he had all the while been in Celadon's Chamber. As the Prince walked to∣wards his Lodging, he told Celadon of his lying hid in the Closet, and all that he over-heard them saying. And now Celadon, (said he) what think you of my Condition? What should I think, (answered Celadon) but that you are happy? for you love and are beloved:

But what good will that Love do me (re∣ply'd he) since 'twill never avail me any farther than the bare acknowledgment? Nay, that she Loves me is rather my un∣happiness, for did she not, perhaps she would continue here, and I might have those smaller satisfactions, the sight of her, and her Conversation:

And I would rather have her Company, though she tortur'd me with disdain, than lose her by this effect of her Love. Your High∣ness (said Celadon) has better Politicks in War than in Love; if in the Battel your Enemy should fly, would you grieve that he did not stand longer, does not his flight do better? If she had strength enough to resist she'd stand; but she, like him, in her flight confesses her weakness, and in retiring before you does seem to say, Come follow me, and Conquer. Your Highness saw her Cousin, my Mistress, though her Face is very ordinary, yet her Shape is handsome; she has a very taking Wit, and I hear she has a Bag of Money would blind one sooner, than the most dazling Beauty:

And (as I am a Souldier) though I have a great devoir for all the Beauties of the fairer Sex, yet, to my thinking, rich Jewels out-shine the brightest Eyes, and the yellow of the Leuidores is a more glorious colour, than the fairest White and Red, that ever made Lover doat, or Poet Rhime:

I am glad they will send to the Indian, for I'll tell them their Fortunes, and order them too, but so much to our advantage, that you shall have your Mistress, and I mine; the way I will go about it shall be this:

Your Highness may desire your Landladies pretty Niece to take her Maid with her, and go to the Indian to know her Fortune, let her order the Maid in the mean time to stay at the Door, and when the Servant comes from Marinda, let her pretend to be the Indian's Servant, and to carry the message up Stairs; let her bring the Servant down word, that her Mistress, the Indian, is busie with Company, but will wait upon her Lady in the Evening; then let the young Gentlewoman grati∣fy the Indian well for telling her Fortune, and tell her that she has a mind to have a Frollick that Night, and desire the In∣dian to lend her one of her Spanish Suits to Masquerade in:

When she has brought this Suit home, I will put it on, and go to Marinda's at the appointed time; I will personate the Indian, my feigned Voice is shrill enough to pass for a Wo∣mans, you know I have got a Foreign tone, as well as she, my height and shape are much the same, and for my Face 'tis no matter, she always wears a Veil, so will I, and as to her gift of Fortune-telling, let me alone to tickle their Fancies. The Prince was mighti∣ly pleas'd with the Stratagem, and said, Go on and prosper, thou cunning Proteus, and may Celadon the Prophetess have bet∣ter luck than Celadon the Franciscan. The Prince sent up for the young Gen∣tlewoman, and telling her that there was an Indian come to Town, who shewed none but Gentry their Fortunes, he de∣sired her to go this Afternoon to ask hers; and told her, that she must bor∣row a Spanish Suit of the Indian, as for her self:

He gave her a Purse of Gold to pay the expence, and leave as a pawn for the Cloaths, in case the Indian, not knowing her, should be unwilling to ven∣ture them without Security. The young Gentlewoman took her Maid with her, and did her business as successfully as they could wish:

She had her Fortune told, and the Prince, to whom former∣ly she made the whole Relation of her A∣mour, was desirous to know what the event of it would be. She told him, that the Indian, smiling, delivered it in these words;

Be Constant, and be Hap∣py.

Thank your kind Fortune, Madam, (said the Prince) how many a Lover would be over-joy'd at such a Prediction!

He spake this with a particular earnestness:

The Fair Virgin gave the Prince thanks, for sending her to know it, and took her leave of him, not without obser∣ving something extraordinary in his Countenance, by which she guess'd that the impartial God of Love, has no more respect for Persons of Quality, than for their Inferiours. Celadon fell to shifting himself, and having put on the Indian's Habit, looked so like her, that the Prince promised himself both Diversion and Success from this adven∣ture. Celadon staid till it grew duskish, because the Night would help the dis∣guise; about an hour after he came back again, and gave the Prince this ac∣count of his Success. I have been at Ma∣rinda's, she took me into the Closet (where you was) very cautiously, lest any one should hear but her Cousin and me, not dreaming who she confessed her self to:

She told me that she did Love you, and yet must dissemble it; that she heard your Highness had been in the House, and she thought 'twas to see her; that she expected you would come to take your leave of her, and did not know how she ought to receive you:

She said that I told her at first, that she should have you, but now desired me to confess freely, whether I spoke truth then, or did it to flatter her humour; for if it were so, she would not indulge her self the sight of you any more, but wean her self from you for altogether. I found by this, that the Indian had soothed her up with the hopes of your Marrying her; I humoured her too, and bade her hope the best:

For had I done contrary, that would have contradicted what the Indi∣an told her, and given her some grounds to suspect me for a Cheat; besides, despair 〈1 page duplicate〉 〈1 page duplicate〉 might have made her refrain your Com∣pany for ever:

She sighed, and said, she would ask my Advice, whenever she had occasion for it. Then her pert Cousin took me up, telling me much the same story that you over-heard her in, and desired to know which of these Lo∣vers she should have:

Your Highness may imagine I gave the Verdict on my own side:

And after threatning her with all the ill fortune, that can be in the o∣ther Servant, I promised her as much happiness in my self; and was so large in my own praises, that it made me blush, under my Veil, while I uttered them. She proffered me a reward for what Advice I gave her, yet would not tell me whether she would take it or no. But when I had parted with them, and thought the Joke was over, the plea∣santest part of it was to come; for at the Door I met a pretty young Lady, who was come to pay a visit to Marin∣da: I was at the Ball (says she) when you professed the faculty you have, in fore-telling Events, and now I have met you in a private House, I must needs make tryal of it; saying this, she took me aside, and having conjured me Secre∣sie, she told me, that she lived in Dub∣lin, and was ardently sollicited by one K—k, a great Officer in the Army; that he made her vast promises of kind∣ness and everlasting Affection; and she desired to know whether he would prove Constant, if she trusted him:

After ha∣ving looked fixedly on her Face, and the palms of her Hands, and used those impertinent Formalities, that your pre∣tended Fortune-tellers do, I bade her never doubt it, my Life for it he would prove true. She could not conceal the Joy she conceived, at my favourable answer; and for my good news, and to bribe me to Secrecy, she clapp'd a Jaco∣bus into my Hand. I hope your High∣ness will not blame me, for cozening the poor Maid, for I thought it might prove my own case another time, to de∣sire one to have the same good Opinion of me, and therefore I thought I ought to do, as I would be done by. In the Street I was stopped again, by a spruce Servant Maid, who making a low Curte∣sie or two, desired me to look in her Hand, and give her a proof of my Skill; she brought me into a Kitchen, to a light, and shewed me her Hand, but begg'd me to be secret, because it con∣cerned her Reputation:

I told her, she might speak freely to one who knew not her Name, nor was ever likely to see her again. I am Courted (said she) by an Old Man, who is very Rich; I love a Young one, who as very poor:

The Young one I dare not marry, for fear of Beggery; the Old one I must not, because I cannot endure him:

In this un∣certainty I would live as I am, were it not that the young Man took his advan∣tage on me in the Critical minute; and now I must make choice of one, or the o∣ther, for fear of being with Child, and for ever disgraced; tell me, in this case, which will thrive best with me. I remember'd I was Celadon still, for all my Habit, and therefore considering the necessities of those Youths, whose niggardly Fortune would not let them Marry, and the Dotage of feeble old Age, that will needs be Lovers, when their season's past, I advised her to Marry the Old Man, and keep the Young one; that way (said I) you will enjoy the Love of the one, and the Riches of the other. Her Master coming in at that time, and asking what I was, the Maid told him, I was a Fortune-teller:

Go thy ways, Girl, (said he) and leave me to speak a word to her:

When she was gone, he pulled out a Silver Groat, telling me, I should have that to re∣solve him a question. Sir, (said I) though I sometimes tell the Poor their Fortunes for nothing, yet I never do it to the Rich under half a piece. I am not one of your ignorant rambling Gypsies; I'll tell you your Fortune, as it shall fall out to a Hair:

Well, here's half a Piece for you, (said he) if you tell it so ex∣actly, for 'tis a thing of moment:

I am about to marry a handsome Girl; the only scruple I have against it, is, that these young Jigglets are so wild, that I fear 'twill be hard to keep her constant; tell me therefore, whether she will be true to me, or no? What Age are you of, (said I)? But threescore and eight, (said he): I looked in his Hand, and took his Gold, and told him, that the Virgin would prove as honest to him af∣ter Marriage, as she was to her Vertue, before he Weds her. This was a true answer, for I fancied it was his own Maid that he meant, and how honest she was, I knew by her own Confession. I went away laughing at the folly of Co∣vetous old Age, that would throw more Money away, towards the satisfying an impotent desire, than he would willing∣ly have given a Physician, for the saving his Life. The Prince laugh'd at the pleasant use which Celadon had made of his disguise; and they two debated for a while which was the greater weak∣ness, that of the Old Man, to trust his Honour to a Young Woman's Ver∣tue; or that of the Maiden, to trust hers to the Constancy of an Officer. The Prince placed his own Folly in the first rank; and said, it was greater than the other two, to trust all the re∣pose and quiet of his Life, to the rigour of a disdainful Woman; to cringe to one that was beneath him, and submit himself to one, who could not pretend to a higher Match, than one of his De∣pendants:

But when Love tock her part, it made him recant all these Reflections, clad the meanness of his passion in a lovelier dress, and made it seem, either no fault at all, or one of the least, the most pardonable of his Life. He com∣mended Celadon's discretion, in indulging her the hopes of Marrying him, for fear her Vertue should otherwise have made her shun him. The next morning word was brought to the Prince, that the King was near the Town:

He drew up all his Men, in order to receive his Ma∣jesty; and after having kissed his Hand, and discoursed with him, concerning the preparations requisite to the Siege, the Prince came home to put all things in readiness for his next days March:

But that which he accounted the chief, was to take his leave of Marinda. He found her alone in her Room; and though she seemed uneasie, yet he constrained her to stay, and hear a long story of his Passion; which he set forth in the most prevailing words, accompanied with the most winning Carriage, that Art and Nature, joyned together, could invent. At last he gain'd so much upon her, as that she consented to receive a Letter from him, while he was in the Camp. He came back to Celadon with a mixture of Gladness and Sorrow; Gladness at the favour she had granted him, the pri∣viledge of Writing to her; and Sor∣row to think that he must purchase that satisfaction at so dear a rate, as the loss of her Company, as long as the Siege should continue. I will not set down how many of these Fits of Joy and Grief he had, whilst he was in the Camp; neither will I Romance so much, as to white down all the thoughts he had of her, and all the many wise Dialogues he had with himself about her; those the Reader can better imagine, than the Author tell; at least, if he has any of the same Passion the Prince was possessed with:

That will make him sympathize exactly with his Highness's thoughts, as two Clocks, well made, keep time with one another. Thus much I know, that they were so impor∣tunate with him, that they could nei∣ther be lull'd asleep, by the stillness of the Night, nor diverted by the terrors of the Day:

They kept him company continually, followed him even into the Enemies Trenches, and when Shot of all sorts flew thickest about his Ears, they were neither still'd by the noise of the greater, nor frighten'd away by the small. Among all these thoughts, he did not forget those of writing to her; nor had he been three Weeks away, when calling to him one of his trustiest Ser∣vants, he ordered him to take Horse for Clonmell, and, with all the privacy ima∣ginable, deliver her this Letter.
To the most Charming MARINDA.

IF I could think that Absence would have the same effect on you, it has on me, I should be but too happy:

Might I hope that it has lessened your Disdain, as much as it has encreased my Love, I should be over paid for all the restless hours, and melancholly thoughts it has cost me. But this is too good Fortune for me to flatter my self with; nor is it likely, that she who shuns her present Lover, should che∣rish his memory when absent. We have block'd your Enemies up, won a Fort from them, and daily gain more ground:

And O that I were as certain of Conquering you; as of ta∣king the Town! But you, my lovely stubborn Enemy, hold out against all
my endeavours:

All the Assaults I make serve but to shew your Obsti∣nacy, and my Weakness, and help to confirm the improbability of my gai∣ning you. Yet Despair it self shall not make me give over; but like a resolute General, who will rather dye in the Trenches, than rise from be∣fore the Town which he has once laid Siege to; so after all your Repulses, my worst of Fortune shall but make me dye at her Feet, whose Heart I could never gain entrance to. But do not rashly resolve on my Ruin, but consider, my Lovely Princess, whether it is not juster for your Pity to in∣dulge that Passion, which your Dis∣dain cannot destroy:

And so instead of proving the death of your Lover, give him his Life, in letting him live to be

Yours, S—g.
The Prince awaited the return of his Messenger with a great deal of Impati∣ency:

The next Evening, as he came from an Assault, his Man came to him; and having told his Highness that he had performed his Message to Marinda, he gave the Prince a Letter from her, which he opened, after kissing the Seal, and, with a great deal of Pleasure, read these words.

To the Prince of S—g.

WHen I received the Honour of a Letter from your Highness, I was in a great strait, whether to return an Answer to it or no:

If I did, I thought it would look like Presumption; if not, like Inci∣vility:

In this hard choice I thought it best to err on the kinder side, and rather incurr the censure of Rude∣ness, than that of Ingratitude. How little I am guilty of the latter, your Highness, too well knows, by being witness to a discourse, which I never design'd for your Ears; but since it 
came to them, I cannot recant it. And though your Highness talks of despairing to take the Town, I can't think you should, when you know how much you have gain'd of it already:

But your Highness deals harder with this, than you do with Lime∣rick; you'll offer no Conditions, be∣cause you expect it will surrender up∣on Discretion; you hope that in vain: for though a Traitor within takes your part, and all the cunning you have assaults it from without, yet these ways will not render your Highness Master of this Fort, which will ne∣ver yield, but upon Honourable Terms.

Your Highness's Most humble Servant, Marinda.
The meaning of this Letter was too plain, to have any false Constructions made upon it; and the Prince, who saw that he must retire, or engage too far, had now a greater conflict with his thoughts, than he had before with the Coyness of his Mistress, he was so equally divided betwixt Love and Interest, that they go∣verned his Breast by turns, sometimes one having the better, and sometimes the other. He thought, however, that so kind a Letter as this seemed to re∣quire an answer; and therefore, upon the Army's taking the Irish-Town, sup∣posing that a little more time would render the King Master of Limerick, he wrote her this answer, to prepare him a kind Reception, when the Camp should break up.

TO THE Most Charming Marinda.

AS our taking the Irish-Town has prepared our way towards the taking of Limerick, so I hope the Surrendry of Limerick will pre∣pare 
mine, towards the taking that which I value above all the Cities of the Ʋniverse, my Lovely Marin∣da; and my hopes will be mightily cross'd, if one Month does not put me in possession both of that, and her:

She shall then see how much better conditions we'll give her, than we do to our Enemies; when we shall make them accept of what Terms the Conquerour pleases to impose; but my Beautious Fortress, even when she has Surrender'd, shall chuse her own Conditions, and impose what Laws she pleases on her Conquerour:

Since, as he receives that Title only from her Favours, so will he any time ex∣change it, for that of the

Humblest of her Servants, S—g.
In this Letter, the Prince spake what he truly thought, that Limerick would soon be taken; for the King had sent for some heavy Cannon to the Camp, to throw down the walls, and a breach once made, there were thousands of English bold enough to have dared all the Enemies Shot, and force their way into the Town, in spite of all the re∣sistance:

But Fortune had otherwise ordered it, for Sarsfeild with an unusual Bravery, marched with a small Body of Horse, farther into that part of the Country which was Subjected to the English Power, than they suspected he durst; surprized the Convoy, and cut∣ting them to pieces, burnt them, their Carriages and Provisions, (which they brought for the Army) to ashes; some of the Carriages he nailed up, and burst the rest; and the Army wanting them to batter the walls, and the hasty ap∣proach of the Winter, not giving them time to send for others, they raised the Siege; his Majesty went for England; his Forces retired to their winter Quar∣ters, and our Prince to his Mistress. I trust, the Reader will not think it pre∣judicial to our Prince's Honour, to come back without taking the Town, this was not his fault, but his Fortunes; the days of Errantry are past, nor have our Warriours now, such Swords as those Knights of old, that could hew a way through the thickest walls, and do wonders greater than our Age will be∣lieve:

Our Prince did not pretend to impossible Exploits, but as far as pure Natural Force, and Courage could go; he might have been ranked in the first File of the Army; he was not ashamed, that he could not do impossibilities, but came back to Clonmell with as brisk a Look, and as glad a Heart, as if he had Routed Sarsfeild, and laid Limerick in Ashes. The place where he Lodg'd be∣fore, was made ready for him, but he had other designs, and therefore Com∣plemented some of the other Officers with those Quarters, and chose Marin∣da's Mothers for his. But when he first accosted his long absent Mistress, 'twas in Terms so passionate, that the inability of the Author makes, him forbear to ex∣press them; nor could he match them, though he borrowed Apollo's Brain to invent, and a Quill plucked from one of Cupid's Wings to write them down; neither would he think it safe to express them to the Life if he could, lest a Passion so well represented might prove infectious to those that Read it; and such Charming Words like those in Ma∣gical Books, might raise a Spirit in some Fair Reader's Mind, some ram∣pant Spirit, that would make the Raiser his prey, before she would be able to lay him again:

Thus much the Author will assure you, that they had as power∣ful an effect, as he could desire over his Mistress; or as the most Amorous of my Readers could wish to have over his own:

She laid aside that reservedness which she observed to other Men, and confessed her Love, as freely as she gave it him; that Night, he told Cela∣don of the welcome he received; and Celadon asked him, whether he intended to Marry her? This Question put the Prince to a stand, and he asked Celadon whether there was any possibility of Enjoying her without it: Celadon told his Highness, he would try, and ac∣quainted him with the vvay, and the Prince approving of it, the next after∣noon he put it in Execution:

He went to wait on Marinda's Cousin, whom he Courted, and they two being pretty Fa∣miliar, the young Gentlewoman began to talk about the Love the Prince bare her Cousin; she did it to sound him, and to find whether the Prince's Af∣fection was real. Celadon, who watched for such an opportunity, said, yes truly, the Prince had an unfeigned Affection for her fair Cousin, so violent a one, that notwithstanding the difference of Quali∣ty, the Prince would Marry her if he were single. What, is he Married then said the young Lady, extreamly sur∣priz'd? Why, did not you know it, Madam, said he? since through inad∣vertency I have blabb'd it out, for Hea∣ven's sake do not let it be known that it came from me, for then I shall be for ever out of the Prince's favour. She promised she would not, and so left him, to carry the News of it with all speed to her Cousin. The Prince having left a great part of his Men in Clonmell, was gone out of Town that Morning at the Head of the rest, accompanying the gross of the Army which was Marching towards Dublin; and on the morrow about mid-day, he took leave of the Officers, to return to Clonmell; he brought but one Man back to wait on him, who had a Horseman's usual Arms, Sword and Pistols, and the Prince had a flight Morin on, and a Buff-coat, both which he wore, rather for the solemni∣ty sake, (because he went with the Ar∣my) than for any use he suspected he should have of them:

Riding along, they came to diversity of Roads; where he and his Man being both Strangers to the Country, lost their way, nor could they meet with any one to direct them into it, only the Voice of some body in a wood just before them; when they drew nearer, they heard the shrieks as of one in distress, and the Prince Riding up, overtook his Man, and put on as hard as he could to see what it meaned; coming nigh, he saw by a Hedge side two Men, who had defended a gap a∣gainst twelve, one of them was fallen, and block'd up that place in his Death, which he maintained whilst alive; but was not unrevenged, for two were kil∣led on the other side, and the other Per∣son stood armed with Anger and De∣spair, and with more Courage than Hopes, maintained the Combat against so unequal a number; the single Person seemed by his Garb to be a Gentleman, he had only a half-pike, which he ma∣naged so actively, that with it, he kept off a row of pitch-forks and Swords, which assaulted him; behind him, stood Lady and her Maid, crying out at every thrust they made at him, and calling up∣on Heaven and Earth for assistance, a∣gainst those barbarous Enemies:

The Prince rode up, and commanded them to desist, and let him know what was the cause of their Quarrel; one of them gave him a short Answer in Irish, and at the same time made a thrust at him with his Pitch-fork, which by the Prin∣ce's sudden spurring his Horse missed him, and ran the Beast into the belly, the Prince drawing out a Pistol, return∣ed the Irishman's Complement with a shot, and laid him dead at his Horse's feet; he had done the same service with his other Pistol, but that the Beast en∣raged with the double wound which Teague's weapon had given him, kick'd and flung so, that the Prince was forced to alight; the Man which waited on his Highness, did more Execution with his Pistols, and having with them, kil∣led one, and wounded another, he alighted and drew his Sword to Fight by his Master, who by this time had dis∣patch'd two more, not without receiv∣ing a great wound, which one of them with a half-pike had given him in the side; the Prince enrag'd at that, fell fiercer on the rest, and the Stranger who hitherto had been only on the de∣fencive part, having but one to deal with, gave him his mittimus to the other World, and came up to fall on those who had more than their hands-full of the Prince and his Man; but at his coming, finding themselves too weak, they sought that safety in their heels, which their Swords could not give them; the Prince and his Man had Jackboots on, and were unable to follow them; and the Stranger was so weary with the Blood he had lost, and the weariness of so tedious a conflict, that he had scarce strength enough to keep him on his Legs; however, he used that little he had in coming up to the Prince, and thanking him for his own Life, and his beautious Companions; the Prince told him, he owed it to his own Valour, and the fa∣vour of Heaven, which seldom fails to help the Couragious, especially when they have Justice on their side:

The Prince ordering his Man to look to the strangers Wounds and bind them up, went himself to Compliment the Lady upon her delivery:

He found her lean∣ing on her Maid, bewailing the Death of that Stranger who was killed before he came there, but how was he amazed, when looking in her Face he found it to be Marinda: When he first came in to her assistance, her Hoods were over her Face; which was the Reason he did not know her, and the Beavor of his Mori∣on being down was the cause of the like ignorance in her; though he very little expected to meet her there, yet the joy to see her safe, overcame his amazement, and he was about to testifie it, with all the extasie which his Passion raised in him:

When she, casting an angry frown at him, said, I thought, Sir, to have given my Deliverer the greatest thanks for the rescuing yonder Gentleman's Life, and my Honour, from the Hands of these wicked Villains; but since it is to you I must pay them; I must at the same time declare, that I had rather they should have taken my Life, than, forced me to owe it to you; go, leave me to be a prey to them whom thou hast hunted away, for I had rather dye here, bemoaning this poor Gentleman who fell in the defence of my Honour, than take refuge with you, who whilst you defend it from others, endeavour to prey upon it your self. He answered her very mildly, and would fain have expostulated with her concerning his Innocence, but she sat over the Dead Gentleman bewailing him, and would not hearken, nor answer one word to what he said; the Prince having found her so kind at his last seeing her in Clon∣mell, wondered strangely at this Capri∣cio of his Fortune, and turning away from her, went to the wounded Gen∣tleman, to see whether he could unfold him the Riddle. He said, all that he knew of it, was, that the Dead Gen∣tleman was a professed Servant to her, as he was to her Cousin, and that Ma∣rinda having made a sudden resolution to go for Dublin, they two proffer'd to accompany her thither; that she would not let them take as much as a Man with them, because she would not have any one know which way they were gone; that she had desir'd them to a∣void the High-roads as much as they could, because she had no mind to be known by any who came from Dublin-ward; that in this by-road they met those Rapperees, who bade them deli∣ver; that the Gentleman who Courted her, shot at one of them and killed him; that then they all fell upon them two, who had no other way to defend them∣selves and the two Women, than by letting them go behind them, and they defend that gap, till some others Riding that Road might come to their help; that the Gentleman was killed, as he made a pass at that second Man who lay Dead by him, and that himself, snatching up the Dead Man's half-pike, as being a better defence than his Sword, had held them all in play till he came into his Rescue. The La∣dies expressing so great a resentment against him, made the Stranger curious to know who it was; but the Servant had no sooner informed him that it was the Prince of S—g, but he begged a thousand pardons for the rudeness his ignorance made him com∣mit; and said, that his Highness had acted with a Bravery suitable to his Quality; and that though he never before had the Honour to know him, yet what he had seen his Highness perform in this little acquaintance, should make him respect him more for his Deserts, than his Title. The Prince had very little relish for all the Praises the Stranger heaped upon him, and only desired him to prevail with the Lady, to go back to Clonmell with him. While the Prince's Man went to catch the Horses, the Stranger persua∣ded Marinda to return back with him; and getting all upon the Horses, they rode before, only the Prince got upon his Man's, and the Man on the Dead Gentleman's, and laying the Body before him, they Rode to the next. Town; the Gentleman's wounds were slight ones, and needed little Cure, be∣sides rest and a recruit of Blood; there∣fore he went with Marinda the next day to Clonmell; but the Prince's wound was large, and had lost him so much Blood, that his Life was in danger. Marinda the next day sent him a Surge∣on, and a Hearse, to carry the Gentle∣man to Clonmell, he was Buried there, and she shewed such an excessive Grief at his Funeral, that no one who knew he Courted her, but thought that she Loved him; the Prince's being wounded came to Celadon's Ears, but he wonde∣red that it was in rescuing Marinda, whom he thought all the while to have been at home; he streight took Horse and came to the Prince, and found him very weak, wanting rest, and incapable of taking any: to hear that his Rival was so bemoaned by Marinda, was worse than Poyson to his wounds; to have seen her prefer another before his face; one who was Dead, and insensible of her Kindnesses, before him, who valued them at so high a rate; and to think, that the other, who was but • private Gentleman, was preferr'd by his Mi∣stress, before him and all his Titles, raised a Noble Indignation in him, which bespread his Face with a redder dye, than that of his Wound. When he had told Celadon her unkind Behaviour to∣wards him; he guessed immediately what was the Reason of it, but would not tell the Prince, for fear it should incense him:

He only made a slight matter of it, and told his Highness that if he woold write a Line by him, for a pretence to him to see her, he would soon accommodate the difference; and set him as much in her Favour as ever; the Prince seemed to give but little cre∣dit to these hopes, but because he would leave nothing unattempted, ordering that no body should disturb their pri∣vacy, he bade Celadon write, whilst he dictated him these words.
TO THE Incensed Marinda.

IF it be a Fault to have rescu∣ed my Fair One from her Ene∣mies; if it be a Crime unpardonable, to have spent a great part of my Blood in revenging the death of my Rival, because I did not lay down my Life with his, then will I offer up the poor remainder of my Blood, to atone for the Cowardise I have been Guilty of; and shall think my Life sold at too dear a rate, if it should draw so many precious Tears from your Eyes, as did that happy Gentleman, who even in his Death triumphed over the Love of his Sur∣vivor. But if I was as willing to expose my self for your sake, and he was the first in your Defence, only by the good Fortune, of being with you at the beginning of the
danger; I know not why the living Servant should not share more of your favour than the dead one; since he would have died as willingly at your Feet, had not your Fortune commanded him to live till he con∣quered your Enemies. Now he has kept his Life too long, since it is become odious to you, and would gladly lay it down before the Face of his incensed Divinity, if his weakness would permit him to come there:

And if he has any desire at all to live, it is only so long till you let him know in what he has offended you:

This sure is the least you can grant to one, who was once so happy in your favour; and 'tis all the satisfaction your Criminal de∣sires, to know why you have con∣demned him, since he has always been the

Faithfullest of your Servants, S—g.
When Celadon got to Town, he came streight to Marinda's:

She was not to be spoken with, but he met with Diana, (so was his Mistress called) and after the usu∣al Complements past, he asked her how he should speak with her Cousin:

No way, (said she) there's no access for you, because you come from the Prince. Why, Madam, said he, is not Marin∣da, satisfied that the Prince has suffici∣ently hazarded his Life in her defence, but that she'll endanger it farther by her Cruelty? Cruelty! (answered she) why what kindness can he expect from a Vir∣tuous Woman? Or what would the Wedded S—g with the Chaste Marinda? And is that all the reason of her Anger? (said Celadon,) Has the poor Prince suffered all this for a word of mine? By Heaven (Madam) the Prince is single, and I am perswaded has as ver∣tuous designs on your Cousin, as I have on you. If he has no more on her (an∣swered she) than I have on you, he would never again be at the expence of a sigh for her:

For your part, I here discharge you my acquaintance; your mischievous Jest has been the cause of a great deal of Grief, both to my Cou∣sin and me, for the Gentleman's death, the other Gentleman's weakness, and the endangering the Prince's Life:

You have jested fairly, you had like to have jested the Prince at once out of his Life and Mistress, your-self you have jested out of my Favour, I will assure you; and so farewell good jesting, Mr. Celadon, for if I ever any more admit of your Jests, I'll give you leave to make a Jest of me as long as you live. Saying this she flung away into her Cousins Room, and all that Celadon could say, could not get either of them to speak a word to him. She told Marinda that the Prince was innocent, and, by Celadon's Con∣fession, had no designs, but what were honourable and virtuous:

At the same time the Maid came up, and brought them a Letter, which Celadon sent to Marinda, and the same which he had written from the Prince's Mouth; the Servant told them that he was returning to the Prince, and desired to see them before he went, that he might know what Service they had to command him. Neither of them would consent to see one who had been the Author of their late troubles:

But Diana told her Cou∣sin that the Prince, who was innocent, ought not to suffer for him; that she should rather shew her self kinder than ever, to one she had so causelesly tor∣mented: Marinda's own Love did take his part so much, and joyn so prevalent∣ly with her Cousin's Arguments, that it made her give some small interval to her Griefs, to pay that which was due to her Love. She wrote a Letter, and sent it to Celadon, who made what haste he could to leave an angry Mistress, to see his wounded Prince, and cure his Body, by this sovereign Ballsom which he brought for his mind. The Prince (when he came before him) would not stay to tell him how he did, till he first asked how he had succeeded. As well for you, Sir, (said he) as you can wish, and as ill for my self; how ill for my self, I will tell you hereafter; how well for your Highness, this Letter will acquaint you. At these words he gave him the Letter; and the Prince, with a great deal of haste, breaking it open, found these words.

To the Prince of S—g.

HOw shall I be silent, when Justice ob∣liges me to confess I have wronged you? Or how shall I have the face to con∣fess 
a Rudeness, which a misunderstanding made me guilty of? I was too rash to con∣demn you without a hearing; but I hope your Highness will pardon that rashness, when you shall consider it was in the defence of (that which I prefer before all things) my Vertue. Through the weakness of my Sex makes me careful of my life; yet did your Highness need it, I could willingly expose it as lavishly in your behalf, as you did yours in mine:

Yet my Innocence (which is dearer to me than that Life) I must not sacrifice, no, not to you. Your Highness has more Generosity, than to begrudge a Gentleman a few Tears, who lost his Life in my defence:

They were no more than what I owed both to Gratitude and Humanity:

Neither ought you to infer from thence, that the Dead shares more of my Favour than the Living:

I would convince you of the contrary, if it were fitting:

But your Highness's condescention must not make me forget, that you are a Prince, and that my highest deseres rise no higher than to be the

Humblest of your Servants, Marinda.
You deserve all things, Divine Ma∣rinda, (said the passionate Prince) what Ti∣tle is too High, or Estate too Magnifi∣cent to admit you for a Partner? I will no more indulge this vain Ambition, or let it cross my Love:

Tell me, Celadon, (said he) does not Marinda, with her na∣tural Beauty look finer than our Proudest Court Ladies, tho' decked with all their Gaudy Costly Dresses? Yet that lovely Body is but the Shell of a more glorious Inhabitant, and is as far out-shone by that more radiant Gust, which lies within, as your choicest Jewels exceed the lustre of the Cask, which holds them:

For her Illustrious mind has got as inexhaustible a store of rare perfections in it, as the famed Potosi has of Riches:

And as in that the greedy Spanish Conquerour, the farther he diggs, finds still more new supplies of Ore; so whoever makes him∣self Master of her richer Heart, will still discover there new Mines of Radiant Ver∣tues, so infinite they are, that they would tire the most inquisitive Lover to find them all, and each of them has such pe∣culiar Charms in't, enough to make him leave his scrutiny after more, to admire that one which his first search does find. Ah, Sir, (said Celadon, now your High∣ness is happy and in favour, you do not consider him who is clearly cast off by his Mistress, for what he did only with de∣sign to serve you; for it was my telling Diana that your Highness was married, and confessing the falshood afterward, has so put me out of her favour, that she has forbidden me ever seeing her again. Tho' (said the Prince) that was an unlucky Po∣licy of yours, yet since 'twas well designed, you shall not suffer for it, and therefore take my word, that the same day which makes me happy, shall make you so to; and as our Loves are joyn'd, so shall our Fortunes. Your Highness (said Celadon) cannot be more in Love with the perfecti∣ons of your Mistress, than seem with the Wit and good Humour of mine:

Besides, her Baggs which are so large and temp∣ting, it would grieve my heart to part with them, after I was in so fair a way for obtaining her. The Prince answered, that both their Loves waited only for his Health, and then he would soon see them consumated. He wrote two or three Let∣ters more to Marinda whilst he lay ill, but the Reader must excuse me, if I produce them not here, since Marinda burned them to prevent a discovery; and Secretary Celadon was not so careful to keep any Copies. Now had the active Sun run through our Celestial sign, and his pale Sister gone through her Monthly course, and changed her Orb, whilst the poor Prince kept his Bed, and with the loss of Blood had been as pale as she; at length the help of Art restored his Health, strengthning Nature began to exert her power, and tho' she was not risen of a sud∣den to her former vigour, yet she made great advances, and every day perceived her strength encreasing:

His impatient Love would stay no longer than till he was able to travel, and then it carried him back to Clonmell, to see his long absent Mistress:

He rode to his Lodgings at Marinda's Mo∣thers, but hearing Musick in the House, and the Mirth of Company within, he asked what was the Matter. 'Tis, (said one) a preparation for Madam Diana's Wedding, who is just now to be Married. Married! said Celadon, O that I had ei∣ther come sooner or later; for my Ho∣nour sake I cannot see my Mistress Mar∣ried away before my Face, and yet I am come too late to prevent it; but what can be done on such a sudden I'll do. Saying this, he alighted, and rushed into the House, and the Prince followed him in to see what his design was. Celadon entered just as the Ceremony began, and with a threatning voice cryed,

I forbid the Banes; and if the intended Bridegroom will 
defer his hopes so long, to go aside with me, I will convince him, that my Title to her is bet∣ter than his.

The Company wonder'd to see this Challenge laid to her; her Re∣lations, who were by, expected her to speak; but she was prevented by the Bridgeroom, who fiercely cryed, that it belonged to none but him, to vindicate his Title to her:

Some Officers were there, the Bridgerooms Friends, and would have taken up his quarrel, but forbore out of respect to the Prince, ex∣pecting what he would do in it. The Prince knowing the Gentleman to be the same whom he had seen Combat with so many Enemies, to save Marinda, had such an opinion of his Valour, that the would fain have decided the Quarrel, without injuring either of the Pretenders:

Had she been at his disposal, Celadon should have had her, if at her Parents, they had decided it for the Spaniard: There∣fore he thought it best to leave it to her self, and therefore spoke to this purpose.

Gentlemen, I have such an esteem for you both, that I would not have you fight, since, which e∣ver falls, the Law will lay hold on the other, and so in striving which shall have the Lady, both of you will lose her; if you will stand to my advice, let it be thus. Refer your Cause to the Lady, and give her three days time to con∣sider 
of it, in which time let both of you have free access to make your Court to her, and at the three days end, let her take which she will:

If, Celadon, her choice does decide it against you, you must submit; but if she like you best, there is no reason why your stay∣ing with me in my illness, should make you lose your Mistress.

The Gentleman said, that, since he owed his Life to the Prince's Valour, he would not deny him this; and Celadon was glad to win so much to try his Fortune in. While the three days lasted, the two Suiters took their turns to Court Diana: On the fourth day, the Musick play'd again, the Priest was present, and the admiring Company stood in suspence, to see who was the destined Bridegroom. The Bride stood out, and in making her Choice, spake thus:

You are here come together, my Relations, and good Acquaintance, to set me Married, and I am happy in having the choice of two Gentleman, the refused of which may, if his deserts are answered, have many a better proffer; however, if they were ever so good, one of them must be rejected, therefore I would not have the disappointed one take it ill that I refuse him. One of them has been longer my Servant, but the other was more zealous while he was so:

The Spaniard has been the more Complaisant, but the English∣man 
the Fonder:

The Spaniard the truer Courtier, but the Englishman the truer Lover; therefore, as commonly Love is soonest raised in one Breast, by seeing it first in the other, so the Englishman has the advantage of the Spaniard, and my heart catched that Passion, as it were by Contagion from his:

Yet, on the other side, I should not forget my Duty; my Father takes the Spaniard's part, well, but Love takes the Englishman's:

Then I must beg my Father's pardon, if I leave the Spaniard to receive his reward from him whom he courted, and desire the Company to judge, if I ought not rather to yield him my Love, who sued to me for it, than to him who Courted my Parents.

The Company was divided in their opinions, as their Ac∣quaintance byassed them; and some mur∣mured as the Inconstancy of her Humour, whilst others applauded her Choice. Ce∣ladon ran to give her thanks, with all the kindest expressions his Joy could inspire him with; and his Rival, distracted with Grief and Shame at his unexpected re∣pulse, stood uncertain on that sudden E∣mergency, how to behave himself:

He was awaked out of this Trance, by a Gen∣tlewoman, who came to him, and said, Take heart, Seignior, be not ashamed of a Denial, which not your want of Merit, but my Contrivance was the occasion of; 'twas I that persuaded the Lady to refuse you, and I trust you will pardon me, when I say it was for my own sake that I did it. Without question the Company thought this an odd sort of Confidence, for a Gentlewoman to Court a Man, in so kind terms, and so publickly too:

Her Garb was very fine, her Shape and Air gentile, and her Face, which was one of the most amiable ones there, spake her to be in the prime of her years; yet neither her Dress, Youth, Beauty, or Love, could prevail the least on our discontented Spaniard, who would not once vouchsafe to look on her. What then, (said she) is my Constancy thus requited? Or can two years time cause so much alteration, as to make Astolfo forget me? These words made the Spaniard turn towards her, and he no sooner saw her Face, but he cry'd out, am I in a Dream? Or do I truly behold once again, the Face of my beloved Faniaca? Now, Celadon, I yield thee up thy Mistress, and quit all my pretensions to her, for this which I have newly found. Celadon gladly thank∣ed him for his submission to Diana's Choice, and all the Company bore a part with the Spaniard in the Joy he conceived at the change of his Mistress:

But the beautiful Indian, who longed to hear how he came for Ireland, said, It is now, my A∣stolfo, two years since you and I parted, wonder not then if I am desirous to know what befell you since that, and how you escaped a Death which so apparently threatned you; my endeavours to find you out here, made me relate all the pas∣sages of our Acquaintance hitherto, and therefore I believe there is no accident in the remaining part of your Life, which is too secret for the Ears of this honourable Company:

I have had none, (said he) which I will not freely tell, but to the understanding my Relation, it is requi∣site that this Illustrious Company should know some things, which for want of op∣portunity, have as yet been a secret to you, as well as to them. My Father is a Gen∣tleman of a plentiful Estate near Sevill, by my Mothers death he was left a Wid∣dower with two Children, Me and a Daughter, both which he was very fond of, as being his only Comforts, the Relicts of his deceased Wife, and the Pledges of his youthful Love:

There li∣ved near us an old Couple who had the like number of Children, a Son and a Daughter, they were intimate Friends of my Father's, and so free with us, that notwithstanding the severe restraints of our Countrey upon young Persons, yet our Families observed no such Custom, but we young ones conversed with one another with the same freedom as if we had been near Relations:

And as youth∣ful familiarity in different Sexes, usually ends in Love, so it proved with us, for our Neighbour's Son and my Sister had such a mutual Affection, that they were never well but in one anothers Company; and his Sister, whether by her own incli∣nation, or their setting on, seemed as uneasie unless when she was in mine; had she been handsome, perhaps I should have taken as much diversion in his Sister's Company, as he did in mine; but I thought those Complements thrown a∣way, which were bestowed on an ugly Face; nor could my Wit help me with one fond Vow or happy Expression, for want of Beauty to inspire it; This made me avoid her Company to get into his; but when I saw him shun mine as much, and that he and my Sister coveted to be always together; his growing more re∣served to me than formerly, and some symptoms which I perceived in my Si∣ster; her frequent sighs at parting, her blushes at meeting him, and some other slips, which the most dissembling of your Sex find difficult to hide, gave me appa∣rent cause to think that she loved him. He and I were once as great as 2 Brothers laid our Breasts open to one another thence his never discovering the least to me, concerning his passion for my Sister, made his Love look to me, as if it de∣signed nothing that was honest. I had then to wait on me a Turkish Captive, who was taken away young, and having been bred up several years in my Father's House, was very trusty and discreet; I let no one know my suspitions, but him, and ordered him to be a Spy on all my Sister's Actions; and if ever he observed any thing remarkable between them two, that he would acquaint me with it:

He observed my Commands, and one time brought me word, that he had over-heard him and my Sister discoursing; that she desired him to ask her of my Father, and that very soon, or she should be discovered to be with Child, and so be disgraced, and turned out of Doors; tho' this was but what I feared to find out, yet now I found those fears true, it enraged me both a∣gainst him and my Sister:

However, the consideration of her Sex's weakness (which is an unequal Combatant for Love, when assisted by earnestness and opportu∣nity) made me pardon her so far, as to leave her to be punished by the ill conse∣quences of her own Folly; but him I re∣solved to be revenged on:

Tho' my blood boyled at the first sight of him, yet I dis∣sembled my anger in publick, and told him that I had something to impart to him, if he would take a walk with me into the Fields in the cool of the Evening; he consented, and we went out together; at we walked on talking, I drew him insen∣sibly to a private place, and then reti∣ring a little distance from him, I bade him draw:

Sure you are in jest (said he) you will not draw that Sword against your Friend, which you have before now drawn in my defence:

This Sword (said I) was drawn then for my Friend, but now against the worst of mine Enemies, one who has abused my Friendship, and my Sister's Love:

Yet thus much I will give to our former Affection, Marry her, and salve up the Injury thou hast done her, and I will forgive thee mine:

What, (said he) and are you turned a Bravo to hector me into Marriage? Know then that I will never do it, neither shall it ever be said, that Guzman valued his Ho∣nour so little, as to make a Wife of his Whore. Whore! (said I) that word I will engrave on thy traiterous Heart; at these words he leapt back and drew, I made at him with a great deal of Fury; but being appeased by some Blood I drew from him, I proffered him again the same conditions of Reconciliation; but his Rage made him deaf to Reason:

We fought on, till one thrust I made at his Breast ended our difference, by his fall:

I fled in all haste to the Sea-side, where by good chance there was a Ship under Sail bound for the Indies; I went aboard her; Landed in America amongst some Souldi∣ers, who were sent to re-inforce our Country Garrisons there:

I was a pri∣vate Souldier, till a Fight that I signali∣zed my self in, raised me to a Captain's Commission; 'twas in this station I was, when I came acquainted with you:

You know the Captain of the Man of War, which boarded us, sent me Prisoner to Se∣vill, with my other Countrymen:

Near this Town my Father lived; I sent him word of my being in Prison, and he streight came to see me, but told me, he must not own me for his Son, lest it should cost me my Life:

He applauded my revenging the dishonour done to my Family; but said, that there had been Warrants issued out against me, and 500 Duckats, by the deceased's Friends, promised him that should seize me; that if I should stand a Tryal, and escape the Law, yet their pri∣vate revenge would reach me; therefore, he said he would make Friends for me and my fellow Prisoners, that we should be dismissed, and then he would have me spend some years abroad, and when Time, or Death had cured the malice of my Enemies, he would get my pardon, and call me home. I took his advice, and as soon as I was freed, hearing that the Hollanders were raising Souldiers, for some design they had not yet divulged, I entered Volunteer into that Party which came for England; you have all heard how we succeeded, and that instead of a Battel, we came as it were to a Triumph; for the English came over to our side; thence we took Shipping for Ireland, and in Dublin I received a supply from my Father, which bought me the Command of a Troop; I was at the Boyn near Schomberg when he was killed; I lay in the Camp before Limerick, and took my chance of War, among those Brave Men that fell in the Trenches; I Quarrelled with the Prince t'other Night, mistaking him for some Rival that Serenaded Diana; but the Guards coming up, and my finding out my Errour, delivered me from his Sword too:

I was afterwards engaged with ten Irish at once, and fortunately rescued by the Prince's Valour; so that my kind Stars preserved me through all these dangers, to fall the second time a Victim to your Eyes, my former Conquerours; I Courted I confess that Lady, but it was, because I saw not the least likelihood, of ever finding my Beloved Faniaca; and therefore, I thought her Fortune would prove a good shelter for a Punished Man, who had been tossed from Spain to the Indies, from the Indies to Spain, from Spain to England, from England hither, and one, that durit not set foot again on his Native Country:

Besides her Wit and good Humour, placed her much in my Esteem, though all those Perfections vanish in any Woman, when you my incomparable Mistress are by. Thus the Spaniard ended his Relation, and the Company with no little pleasure, reflected on the alterations of Fortune; which, after tossing them so far asunder, by the contrary gusts of Adversity, now by one prosperous Gale, brought them together to their desired Harbour:

The two Happy Couple, would willingly have prevented all future dangers, by fastning that indissoluble Knot, which nothing but Death can untye, but Marinda de∣sired, her Cousin, to forbear hers for two or three days; and the Fair Indian desired her Spaniard, to defer their Joys so long, it not being fit, that she should be admitted to so Solemn a Ceremony of the Church, as that of Matrimony, till she were first listed among the num∣ber of her Children:

The Priest who came there no Celebrate their Marriage, performed this Solemnity, and all the Company wished the Fair Convert Joy:

Mirth and Feasting took up the rest of the day, and made up an intire Friend∣ship, between the Brisk Celadon, and the Valiant Spaniard, who now Quar∣relled no longer for a Mistress. But if some good natured Reader should be too much concerned for the Amorous Prince, whose Intrigue seems to have stood still, whilst the others have run almost to the end of their Race; let him know, that his went the same pace with theirs; though the Author, to comply with Ma∣rinda's Modesty, brought her not so openly acting the Lover's part, as he did the brisk Diana, or the bolder In∣dian; for as the main wheel of a Clock, though it turns all the rest, yet goes it self with such an insensible motion, that to an unskilful Eye it seems to stand still; so the Prince's and Marinda's A∣mour, was carried on indiscernably to others, and seem'd to them to be at a stand, whilst indeed it was the chief mover of the two other Intrigues, and pointed out to them the long wished for, the Matrimonial Hour:

You must there∣fore understand, that after all the dark unsuccessful days which our Prince had sighed away, in doubtful Hopes, di∣stracting Fears, and his last black ones of Despair; Fortune vindicated her old Title of Inconstancy, in being kind to him again, in bringing him that propi∣tious critical minute, in which they say, the Coyest Lady (if you nick the right time) is to be won:

The Prince exact∣ly hit it in the first Visit he made Ma∣rinda; as soon as the designed Marriage was deferred, and the Company gone, he went to pay his particular Respects to the Lady of his Vows:

He found her in the Garden with her Cousin, dis∣coursing about the unexpected breaking off her Marriage, and Celadon accord∣ing to his priviledge, taking her into an Ally aside, left the Prince in another, with Marinda; and what time they had there together, he improved to the utmost, in shewing her how sincerely he had been her Servant, from the first sight he ever had of her, till then; and told her, what he required of her in re∣taliation, and upon what Honourable Conditions he expected it; she answered with all the kindness due to so fond a Lover, and with a mixture of that sub∣missive Civility, which she paid him as he was a Prince, tho' one who professed him∣self her Servant; and that his Highness might not censure her to have beep ei∣ther Rude or Cruel in her Behaviour to∣wards him, through the whole course of their Acquaintance; she desired, that he would hear those things from her Cousin's Mouth, which she thought not so fit for her own; Diana was called for, and Marinda desiring her to acquaint the Prince with all she knew of her Thoughts, without disguising any thing; she Dis∣coursed with Celadon apart, while her Cousin began thus to the Prince, who was more than ordinarily attentive. When my Cousin ordered me to tell you her greatest; privacies, those of her Love; she did but give the Reins to that passion, which has alwaies been too strong for her, since first the Graces your Highness is master of, reduced her to the condition of a Lover; and I question not, but she has had undeniable proofs of an equal Affection in you; or else, (by what I know of her Humour) she would rather have Died, than once suffered it to be known; your Highness over-hearing our Discourse at the Well, opened a light to the discovery of that Affection, which otherwise had been doom'd to perpetual obscurity; for though your Highness, did make some Addresses to her, which as she told me, served to ruin her the more, yet they would never have proved any advantage to you; since we both thought, that you spoke out of Raillery more than any se∣rious design; besides▪ in the highest tide of her Passion, she professed, he would rather suffer any thing than own it to you; the first Night your Highness Se∣renaded her, she shewed so little con∣cern at it, till you were gone, that I thought it had been a Frolick of the Spa∣niard's Gallantry, who about that time came acquainted with me, 'twas I spoke to you out of the window, though when the difference of Voice discovered my mistake, I broke off the parly; that time the Indian came to Town, and lighting first into my Cousin's Acquain∣tance, she told her the Dream she had a∣bout you; I will not tell it over again, because your Highness has heard it alrea∣dy, only in vindication of the Indian's Skill, let me assure your Highness, that she told my Cousin, she should have the Gentleman she Dreamed of; she inter∣preted the little Archer, who was on your side, to be Love, the Giant on hers, Honour; that Honour's going o∣ver to your side, and leaving her defence∣less, signified, that your proffering to Marry her, would overcome her obsti∣nacy; and the Cupid's shooting her through, is easie enough to be left to your Highness's Explanation; the Indi∣an promising her success, made her in∣dulge that Love, which she bridled be∣fore, and brought her abroad to the Ball: Marinda, Madam, was nor at the last Ball, said the Prince: Yes, Sir, said Diana, if your Highness remembers, there were two in Spanish Dress, the one was the Indian, the other Marinda; but sure, said the Prince, Marinda was not not with her in my Room the next day:

She was with your Highness both times, said Diana; nay, it was she whose Ad∣vice you asked in the Closet; she came home that Night, with all the marks of a violent Grief, at something which your Highness had said to her, and re∣solved withall, never to see, hear, or speak to you more; when she represent∣ed the Fortune-Teller, she forbad your Highness to prosecute the Intrigue any farther, unless you designed to carry it on Honourably; and your going on with it, by giving her your Company so often afterwards, and the Indians 〈◊〉 averring that she was destined for you, made her believe, your Highness had altered your mind for the better; as you know, Lovers above all People are aptest to believe things will come to pass fortunately, meerly because they would have it so; this her belief was strength∣ned by the kind promising Letter you sent her from Limerick; which Letter, induced me too, to think that your Highness had designed something to her advantage:

You saw what a free reception she gave you, at your return from the Camp, till Celadon's telling me that you were Mar∣ried, dashed all the Joy I conceived at the prosperity of her Amour, and was very near breaking her Heart, in endeavou∣ring to gain a Conquest over her Love; but when she found how difficult that was, she said, she would punish your illegal Pas∣sion, and her own at the same time; and lest a fit of Love should make her recant, she put it in Execution immediately; there was a Gentleman of a considerable Fortune, who had seen her at my Father's in Dublin, and fallen in Love with her; this Gentleman being then come to Clon∣mell to see her, she desired him to wait on her to Dublin, and I desired my Ser∣vant the Spaniard, that he would accom∣pany her thither; she told me, that she would rather Marry him whom she did not Love, than give a longer encourage∣ment to any unlawful Affection, which your Highness might entertain for her; that would have bereaved you of her for ever, had not she been met by those Rapperees; her Servant fell there, and though she was mightily concerned for your Highness's danger, yet her Vertue drew those Tears from her, which she thought due to her Defender's Misfor∣tune; and might serve to make you de∣spair, ever coming into her favour a∣gain:

But when Celadon undeceived us, by telling me that your being Married, was only an invention of his own, Shame and Love returned very powerfully upon her; Shame, that she had used you so ill without a cause; and that Love, which before was only supprest by her Resent∣ments, flourished now with greater vi∣gour than before; This discovery which regained your Highness her Affection, lost Celadon mine; and my Anger at his crafty deceit, and his being the cause of so much bloodshed, (though innocently) made me resolve on the same way to get rid of him, which my Cousin designed against you, that is, by Marrying ano∣ther; and the Spanish Gentleman, who had my Father's Consent, coming then wounded from a Journey which he un∣dertook to serve me; I thought once to reward his Service, and punish Celadon's Falseness, and imagined I might do it with less disturbance, whilst your indi∣sposition kept him out of the way; but Fate, which they say presides over our Marriages, as well as our Deaths, orde∣red it otherwise, and brought him just time enough to suspend it. The Prince gave the most ample demonstrations of Joy, at the setledness which this Rela∣tion shew'd to be in Marinda's Love; and having thank'd the Ingenious Diana for the comfort she had given him, he walked towards the other Couple; they joyned Company, and the Prince desired Marinda that she would compleat his Happiness, by setting Celadon as high in his Mistress's Favour, as himself was in hers:

The Beautiful Marinda grant∣ed him this request, as the first demon∣stration of her Obedience; she endea∣voured it so effectually, that presently she made her Cousin pardon Celadon's for∣mer miscarriage, and receive him again into her favour; neither did Marinda find it any thing difficult to persuade her to this; for of all People, Mistresses are the most forgiving, indulgent Persons to those they Love; and let them dis∣semble it as much as they please, they cannot be long Angry at any fault a Lo∣ver commits, unless it seem to proceed from want of Affection; but Celadon not being of that Nature, was soon for∣given, and as a proof of it, was encou∣raged to hope she would Vote for him:

The next morning, the Indian came to wait on the two Cousins, and told Dia∣na, that he who was in Election to be her Husband, was the Spaniard whom she had been so long looking for; Marinda had invited her to the Wedding, and she came in a little after the Prince had deferr'd it, and then seeing it put off, would not discover her self to the Spa∣niard; she desired Diana to keep him still in ignorance, that when he was re∣fused, she might see how he would ex∣cuse himself to her: Diana desired no less than she, that it might be kept secret, lest Celadon should esteem her love the less, thinking that the Spaniard being owned by another, made her take him for a shift; this was the result of the three days Tryal, and hence it came to pass, that the Spaniard dejected at the loss of one Mistress, was elevated by the unexpected finding out another, whom he Loved better:

The short prorogation of their Marriages, only continued till the Prince had prepared for his; at last the expected day came, and rewarded the three longing Lovers with the intire pos∣session of their Mistresses:

The Beautiful Marinda, the Ingenious Diana, and the Pritty Faniaca, submitted themselves to the power of their Youthful Conque∣rours. Diana had all the felicity she could wish, in having him she Loved; the Indian gained not only her dear Spa∣niard, but a Fortune with him, for he that day received News from his Father, that his old Enemy was Dead, his Pardon taken out, and with it, he had orders to come home, and take pos∣session of an Estate his Father gave him; the Beautiful Marinda received the re∣ward of her invincible Vertue, in Loving and being Beloved, and in having gained a Prince, who raised her Quality as high (in comparison of what she was before) as a Woman's Ambition could desire; these were the Pleasures of the Wedding Day, heightned by the addition of Mu∣sick, Feasting, and Mirth; but the Night came, we must like their Bride Maids, conduct them to their Beds, and draw∣ing the Curtains leave them there, to the full Enjoyment of those Pleasures, whose Raptures, none but Experienced Lovers know, and the Constant ones may expect to attain.
FINIS.
