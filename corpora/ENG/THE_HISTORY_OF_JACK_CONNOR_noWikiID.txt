THE HISTORY OF Jack Connor.

VOLUME I.


Whoever thinks a faultless Piece to see,
Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.
In ev'ry Work, regard the Writer's End,

Since none can compass more than they intend;
And if the Means be Just, the Conduct True,


Applause, in Spite of trivial Faults, is due.
POPE.

To the Right Honourable HENRY FOX, 
Esq
His MAJESTY'S Secretary at WAR.

SIR,

THE Generality of Dedications are drawn like Bills of Exchange for full Value supposed to be given in Compliment and Encomium, but this Address expects no pecuniary Indulgence; neither does it beg a Protection which no Man can give from public Censure; neither does it seek your Favour to the Author, since he is already honoured therewith. The Performance which it introduces, is founded on the Principles of INTEGRITY and HONOUR, and naturally

inclines to Him who excells in those Virtues; and did I know a Person who enjoys a larger Portion, you might probably have seen another Name at the Head of these Pages. If they afford Matter of Amusement to you, and Matter of Improvement to those who want it, they will answer every End that the Author proposes, while, by the Concealment of his Name, as well from you as from the Publick, he can, without Suspicion of Partiality to your Person or Virtues, have the secret Pleasure of declaring himself, with the justest Esteem and Regard,

Sir,
Your most obliged, and most obedient humble Servant, W. C.


Ashburton, 
1 July, 1751.





TO THE READER.
THE Historian is an absolute Stranger to most of the People of the present Age, therefore can never pretend to the Honour of satyrizing any Man, or any Body of Men.
HE has had a Bundle of Papers left him by a deceas'd Friend, who was infinitely more capable of putting them in Form, than he can pretend to, tho' the Recluseness of his Life afforded him abundant Leisure. These Papers contain'd a Variety of Observations, which, he thought, might be useful to Mankind. He has extended these Observations; he has, in some Measure, commented on them; he has dress'd them in the Garb of the Times; he has given them the Air of Romance, and he gives

to the Reader, the absolute Power of determining whether he has done RIGHT or WRONG.

THE Historian has this Advantage over most others, and this only, That the Trifle he now presents to the Publick, has a fair Chance of being impartially dealt with; for, as he is unknown, and will remain so, the critical Eye cannot condemn his Person, whatever it may his Work. His Scribbling may be abused, but he has taken Care to secure his Person from such Treatment, tho' he is not conscious that he has ever merited it.
IRONY, well managed, has ever been a successful Way to fix the Attention; and NOVEL and ROMANCE may be conducted to very laudable Purposes, and answer the End of more learned Writings. The Moral of the following History may correspond with an old physical Aphorism, which I apprehend may be found in the SCHOLA SALERNI, wrote in the Days of WILLIAM the Conqueror.


Qui medicas artes exercet, noscere partes
Debet ad aegrotum dandi mistum bene potum.
Nam varium est herbis genus: haec impletur acerbis,
Illa salutaris succis ditescit amaris.
Horum quodque datum per se, vomitum atque screatum
Excitet, ast istis inerit sua gratia mistis.
Expedit ergo cato medico studere palato,
Ne stomacho turbas det, cum dedit, inscius, herbas;
Effectum et perdat, dum, sic quod praecipitur, dat.
Expedit et cautè praescribere, fallere lautè;
Mollibus hoc verbis, hoc mitibus efficit herbis.
Has monitas tu res et praeceptas nisi cures,
Non Medici, Vir, te adpellem, sed nomine Agyrtae.

PURE and elegant Latin is not to be expected in Monkish Verses, and a classical Nicety is too unreasonable a Request. Such as

they are, they afford me a Conjecture, that the learned DOCTOR MEAD is oblig'd to them, at least for the Title of his new Book, Monita et Praecepta Medica. Be this at it will, I shall only beg Leave to give, to the English Reader, their Meaning in his own Language. A skilful Physician will consult the Constitution of his Patient, and not madly pour down even the most salutary Medicines. Some Herbs are fill'd with sour, and some with bitter Juices, too disagreeable to be given singly. Physick, like good Counsel, must be administer'd with Caution, or the Stomach will revolt. The Patient must be decoy'd into a Cure, and the unpalatable Drug must be convey'd in the most innocent Vehicle his Judgment can furnish. He who acts otherwise, merits not the Title of a Physician, but of a Quack.






THE HISTORY OF Jack Connor.


CHAP. I.


The Rise, the Progress, of the human Heart,
The real Honour, the Disguise of Art;

The Wise, the Good, the Vicious;—all I sing,
Oh Thou! from whom our ev'ry Actions spring,
Not the poor Author, but the World inspire,
If not the Stile, the Moral to admire.
Learn from the Child, he places in your Sight,
To act with Justice, and to judge aright.

ANONIMOUS.




THE Actions of Monarchs, the Intrigues of Ministers, the History of Battles and Slaughter, and the Revolutions of Kingdoms, are Subjects, that rather surprise and astonish the Generality of Readers, than

improve or amend the Heart. A great, wicked, or virtuous Man, plung'd into the utmost Distress, must raise our Pity and Compassion: A Glorious and a Wise Prince, triumphing over Foreign or Domestick Enemies, and fixing his Crown in the Affections of his People, must warm the rational Mind, and give Delight and Pleasure; but what have the Bulk of Mankind to do with their Greatness? Their Misfortunes or Successes may make us cry out, 'Tis strange!—'Tis wondrous strange! But how can we make the Application to ourselves? The wide Difference in our Situations, almost renders it impossible, and, if by Chance, something like a Parallel should arise, it must be stript of all pompous Terms;—the Rubbish of State and Parade must be removed; and the Whole levell'd to the Sphere we act in.
PERHAPS, Reflections of this Nature, gave Rise to BIOGRAPHY. The Story of the Calamities, or good Fortune of private Persons, must sensibly affect every private Reader, and, as the Incidents are natural, and what every Man is subject to, he with Ease applies the Inferences, and, in some Measure, may be said to read himself.

THE Papers and Memorandums, committed to my Care, gave Rise to the following

Account of JOHN CONNOR.—I will not affirm that I have acted impartially, because I will not presume doing, what, I am afraid, no Historian ever did. If I assure my Readers I am quite unbias'd, yet I hope to be indulged, like the Rest of my Brethren, when I sometimes act otherwise. I cannot avoid saying, I have consulted the Ease of my Reader as much as possible, by not swelling this Work into Twenty Volumes. As a Proof of my Indulgence, I have shortened my Prefatory Discourse and this Introduction above One Hundred Pages, and shall proceed directly to the History.
JEREMIAH CONNOR, the Father of JOHN, whose Story I now write, had been a well made, athletic Man, and a Soldier in King WILLIAM'S Army in the War in Ireland. When that Matter was settled, he quitted that Sort of Life, and passing through sundry Services, at last settled with Sir Roger Thornton, a Gentleman of great Honour and Fortune, in the County of Limerick, in Ireland. Here he lived, and his Warlike Scars of Credit, made him assume some Authority, and furnished a large Fund for Conversation. He found the Happiness of being Virtuous in the Cause of Liberty and Common-Sense. Though he was one of the

famous Enniskilliners that joyn'd King William, yet his Reward, like other great Men, was confined to the secret Pleasure of having done his Duty.

IN this Family liv'd DOLLY BRIGHT, who perform'd the Function of Landry-Maid; she was young and handsome; and Jerry observing, she had a docile and tractable Turn, he encourag'd her in it. Being himself a Man of Learning, he took some Pains to inculcate all his Knowledge, and taught her to Read and Write. The Fame of her Erudition a little hightened her Vanity, especially when Sir Roger examined her himself, and declaring her a very surprising Genius, gave her a Kiss and two Guineas to buy a Gown and Linnen.— This unfortunate Present, and a few more of the same Nature, at last alarm'd Lady Thornton, and brought on some Alteration, in which the Lady seem'd in the Right. All Sir Roger's Affirmations were of no Effect; my Lady most violently protested the impudent Slut should quit the House, or she would—. Sir Roger knew the World, and what's more, he knew himself and his Wife, which determined him to make all this easy. He told Jerry Connor, that if he would marry Dolly Bright, he would give him a Cabbin and five Acres of

Ground at a small Rent, and compleat his Happiness, who had been so careful of her Education.
LADY THORNTON objected to this, but finding Sir Roger grow warm and somewhat peremptory, she acquiesced.—Though Jerry Connor was thirty Years older than Dolly, they willingly consented to the Match, and Peace was restor'd to the Family.
THUS Jack's Parents were fix'd in a Farm about twenty Miles from Thornton Castle. Jerry was Fifty-five and Dolly Twenty-four Years of Age. To compleat their Joy, the Hero of this History stepp'd forth, and was usher'd into the World the 15th Day of December 1720, just seven Months after their Nuptials, a fine healthy Boy, and the very Picture of Jerry Connor.

WHETHER it was from the frequent Visits Sir Roger paid them, or from some other Motive, my Lady Thornton never rested till she had persuaded him to remove his Family to England. This was a mighty Loss, and poor Connor felt it more and more every Day. They were much in Arrear, and as the Steward could no longer indulge them, they were put to vast Difficulties. This shagrin'd Mrs. Connor, and her Husband was sometimes peevish. Every Misfortune was imputed to one or the

other, consequently many bitter Invectives passed between them, and sometimes Blows. Mrs. Connor generally conquer'd, for an old Wound broke out in his Knee and lam'd him. The good Woman had always great Spirits, which rais'd itself on certain Occasions, to that noble Ardour, which the Vulgar call Termagant, in which her Neighbours and Husband gave her Opportunities to improve.

AT last another Wound appear'd in his Head, and oblig'd him to have Recourse to the Surgeon of the next Town, though ill able to bear the Expence of, at least, a Shilling a Day. However, the Surgeon was a skillful Man, and so managed his Patient, that in a Month he brought a Humour into his Eyes, and in six Weeks he was quite Blind. The Surgeon declared his Sorrow for the Accident, but believed, that had it not providentially happen'd, it must have cost him his Life. The Wound at last heal'd, but Connor thought, and his Wife saw, they were ruin'd; which the Seizing their two remaining Cows, and a Barrel of Potatoes, completely finished; and next Night the good Woman threw Jack on her Back, took her blind Husband by the Hand, and march'd off, with about six Shillings, to seek better Fortune.



CHAP. II.


He tells us,
"When one Sense is supprest,
"It but retires into the rest."

So Poverty, against the Will,


Gives Cunning to assuage the Ill.


ANONIMOUS.



SULLEN and silent were their Travels all that Night, but when Day appeared, they determined to repose themselves at the first Inn that seem'd proper to entertain such Guests, mutually agreeing to postpone all Talk of Affairs, till their Bodies were a little refresh'd. At length a Cabbin appear'd, to which they bended their Steps, and, by the Information of a Linnen Rag over the Door, and a Pipe stuck in the Thatch, they boldly enter'd and call'd for Milk and Bread. Before this could be had, the Woman of the House demanded three Half-pence, and Mrs. Connor pulling out a Piece of an old Glove, which contained all her Treasure, paid for the approaching Breakfast.
AT this Repast the good Creature seem'd very tender of Mrs. Connor, whose Eyes were swell'd with Crying. She ask'd many Questions, as, Where they came from, and

whither going; to which she received a melancholy Account of the past, but not of what they intended to do, being ignorant of it themselves. The poor Woman sympathiz'd with her Guest, who, by a Change of Fortune grew strangely humble, and was now all Humility and Meekness.— God Almighty help you, said the Landlady, 
I'm sure you've Troubles enough;—I pray the sweet Jesus to comfort you, and send you safe in your Journey; — but my dear Sowle, added she, rocking herself, you must not set Grief too much about your Heart, for my poor dear Man in his Grave (God be with his Sowle) left me the Mother of three Children, and one in my Belly, and the Devil a Farthing to bless myself, but three Shillings and Five-pence in Silver and Brass. To be sure it was the Holy Virgin put it into my Head to speak to the Quality that travell'd the Road, and by my own Sowle I got Pence enough, and bred my poor little Creturs to get their Bread as well as myself; for Thady is a fine Boy, and a poor Scolard, and speaks his Latin, and brings home many a Happeny; sweet Jesus bless him! and send me once to hear him say Mass! for my dear Child will be nothing but a Priest, and Father

O'Sloughnesey will send him to France on his own Means; God's Blessing on the sweet Man.—Then my dear little Terence drives the Cows out and home for Mr. Flaherty, and brings me broken Meat, and a Bottle of good Ale when he finds it after the Servants; for the Rogue is as cunning as a Fox.—Pray Jesus I could see him a Priest too!—And my Daughter Noragh, poor Sowle, is always busy enough, and minds the Hens and the Turf, and digs the Potatoes, and serves the Carryers very well ever since Father O'Sloughnesey got me this good House.

SHE was going on, but finding Mr. Connor was more inclin'd to Sleep than Hear, she call'd to her Daughter Noragh to settle the Straw in the other Room, and advis'd the Travellers to rest for a few Hours; assuring them, that the Cow and the Pigs at one End of it, kept it pure and warm. Mrs. Connor conducted her Husband to the Apartment, where, in Spite of every Calamity, Sleep attended and diverted every anxious Thought.
'TWAS about Twelve o'Clock at Noon when they join'd the Landlady. Mrs. Connor was putting her Hand in her Pocket to pay for her Bed, but the kind Woman held it fast and prevented her, swearing she

would not take a Farthing, and order'd Noragh to give them a large Bowl of Milk; then putting some boil'd Potatoes into her Apron, she fix'd the Child on her Back, and, with a sweet Jesus be with you, let them depart.
JERRY greatly prais'd the Tenderness of the poor Woman, and a Conversation ensu'd on their present Circumstances. To be sure, said his Wife, since God Almighty has made you stone blind, and given me this helpless Infant, you can't Work, nor can I go into Service, God help me; so, to be sure, myself can't find out a better Way than to speak to the Quality on the Road, as the Landlady did, though to be sure none of my Kiff or Kin ever did so before; but you know, Jerry, God's Will must be done,—and then she cry'd heartily.

DON'T cry, said Connor, for what Good will that do us?—Though we never begg'd yet, 'tis a Trade soon learn'd, and God knows, our Poverty ought to make us set up very soon.—I formerly mimick'd an old blind Man for Sport, and now I must do it in Reality for Profit.— Take care of the Child Dolly, and don't leave your poor Jerry, and I warrant we

shall eat and drink well enough,—and, what more can any body do?


THE Transition from an Irish Cottager to a Beggar, is very natural and common in the Country. The many Examples of that Sort, enabled the poor Couple to bear, and in some Measure lighten'd their Afflictions. —They now seriously determin'd to begin this new Occupation on the first proper Object, resolving with themselves, not to touch the Capital Stock, but at the last Extremity.
THEY had march'd about seven Miles without meeting any Passengers, but what seem'd as poor as themselves; at last she cry'd out, that a Gentleman in Scarlet appear'd, with two Servants well mounted. This put them into some Confusion, but Jerry, boldly raising his Spirits, assisted his Voice, and in the most pathetick Manner, begg'd a little Charity to a poor blind, old Soldier, who once serv'd most faithfully his King and Country.—His Help-mate was not Eloquent on this Occasion, but the Abundance of her Tears supply'd her want of Speech; and perhaps inclin'd the Gentleman to throw them a few Half-pence, which he did in a hasty Manner; and riding smartly on, was followed by a Million of Blessings: But how great was her

Surprise and Joy, when she pick'd up Three Half-pence, and a Shilling? — She kiss'd the Silver a thousand Times, and in her Transport as often kiss'd the Child and Jerry, who were now squatted in the Ditch. She talk'd of Providence and the blessed Virgin; and in Rapture concluded, that please God they'd cheer their Hearts by a Pot of Ale, at the first House.— The poor Man objected to this, and begg'd of her only to spend the Brass, but to put the Shilling in the Glove with the rest.—After much Dispute, and sundry Dissertations on Extravagance and Stinginess, she consented.—But, who can paint the Wildness of her Looks, and the frantick Motion of her Limbs, nor describe her dreadful Shrieks and Exclamations, when she neither found Glove nor Pocket?—They were fairly cut off.—Heaven, and Hell, and Purgatory, and all Mankind, were in an Instant engaged in her Quarrel, till fatigu'd and tir'd with the Violence of her Passion, she threw herself on the Ground, and in a Torrent of Tears, assuaged the Storm in her swelling Breast.
CONNOR bore this Misortune with great Patience, and comforted his Wife out of the Proverbs. He gave her many on this Occasion; and concluded, that Solomon, who was a wise Man, told us, that Riches made

themselves Wings and flew away.—'Don't tell me, Jerry, said she, of such Stuff. I say again and again, our poor Matter of Money would have been safe enough in my Pocket, if we had not slept at that cursed Inn; and as for your Wings, I'm sure they must have been in the old B—'s Fingers.'—'Or, said Jerry, in her Daughter's.—But hang it, 'tis gone— What can't be cur'd must be endur'd.—A Pound of Sorrow never paid an Ounce of Debt.—I've heard a wise Man say, that when the worst has happen'd, we ought to be content, because we know the worst.— Many a cloudy Morning turns out a fine Day.—We are now Beggars, Dolly, and 'twould be a Sin to be Rich; for, sufficient to the Day is the Evil thereof,—and St. PAUL says — Hold your foolish Tongue, cry'd Dolly,—this is fine prating indeed!— Will your Solomon provide a Bed for us to Night? Or will St. PAUL pay for our Supper?—Not they by my Sowle;—They'll talk and make a fine Story, but the Devil a bit will they give to fill a hungry Belly?—Come, come, said he, we have a Shilling still left; let us keep that and our Wits, and my Life for it, we shall pick up a pretty Living.' —So saying, Jack took his Post on his

Mother's Back, and got safe to the next Village. They finish'd the Remainder of their Potatoes, had their Pint of Ale, and went to Rest pretty much as in the former Manner.


CHAP. III.


Begging is not so vile a Trade
As some imagine—some have made.
Vary the Stile, or change the Dress,
You'll find 'tis what we all profess;
The Diff'rence lies 'twixt Rich and Poor,
Some beg for little—Others more.

HUDIBRASTICK.



THE good People continued their daily Travels, and wander'd through many Counties, and greatly improv'd in the Art and Mystery, that was to furnish them with Bread; and indeed, every Day produc'd its Supply. Three Months past in this Manner, till the old Man complain'd of the Fatigue, and most ardently wish'd for a settled Habitation. They were now in the great Road, and within a few Miles of Clonmel, on a pretty Eminence that commanded a good Prospect. 'Twas agreed to fix here, and lodge about a Quarter of

a Mile from the Road; where was an old Hut, which a few Boughs cover'd well enough for the present.
THE Venerableness of Jerry's Beard, which no Razor was suffer'd to visit, had a very good Effect, and the tatter'd Condition of Dolly's Cloaths; Her Hair hanging about her Eyes, a dirty Clout on her Head, and Face and Hands almost of the same Colour, made her look near as old as her Husband, and procur'd the Charity of well disposed Christians so amply, that they had no Reason to repent of their Situation.—In a short Time, the Hut was better cover'd; and they provided themselves with two Cadows, a small Pot, two wooden Platters, two Trenchers, one Knife, and two Horn Spoons. However, this Abode being so distant from what they might call their Shop, made it very inconvenient, and lost them many Customers. This determin'd them to double Diligence, and to save as much as would build a Cabbin by the Road Side, on the Common. A few Shillings compleated this Structure, and their Effects were soon removed.
THUS were they fix'd in a more comfortable Manner than could be imagined, from the Appearance of the Hovel. Business went on in a very prosperous Way;

and, as Money came in, they increas'd their Conveniencies and Utensils; but every thing was added externally that gave an Idea of Misery and Wretchedness.—They often drank Ale, eat Bread, and sometimes Meat, which most Cottagers in the Kingdom are utter Strangers to. In short, they lived as happily as the Impetuosity of Dolly's Temper would admit, which at some Seasons vented itself on Jerry, in old Rogue and old Scoundrel, and such affectionate Epithets, which he bore with the Calmness of a Philosopher, seldom answering but in Proverbs.

SCARCELY had they been settled three Months before some of their Neighbours smoak'd a Pipe with blind Connor and poor Doll. Their great Knowledge surpriz'd them, particularly when they found She could both Read and Write. The Priest of the Parish, who was a young Man, being at last made acquainted with this Prodigy, determin'd to pay her a Visit. One Morning, when she was cleaner dress'd than usual, she was sweetly singing on the Ditch Side, and his Reverence surpriz'd her in the Act of giving Suck. As she knew him, she blush'd, and was going to cover her Neck, which the holy Man prevented with his Hand, saying, God speed your Work, my

dear Child. — Don't be ashamed at what God has given you.—I'm well enough us'd to such Sights!—Perhaps he was; but Mrs. Connor had a Skin of such an wholesome Sanguineness, and Breasts so prominent and firm, as puzzled his Reverence, and made his Blood rise in his Face, and his Speech to faulter.
AS Mrs. Connor durst not disoblige the Priest, she made all the fine Speeches in her Power, and told him almost as much as if she had been at Confession. His Reverence spoke very compassionately on her unhappy Circumstances, and, in a tender Manner, insinuated the hard Fortune, that so young and well-spoken a Woman, should be reduc'd to ask a Favour of any Man; when if she had her due, they ought to ask Favours of her.—Not, my dear Child, said he, that I would be after finding Fault with your Industry, or putting bad Thoughts in your Head. No! no! God forbid! But as you are a sensible Woman, I may tell you, we ought to know Good as well as Bad, that we may avoid the one and follow the other: But when we make a Slip, as we are all frail Mortals, it must be great Comfort to a good Catholick, to have a Holy Priest to pray for, and absolve us.
—At this, he put on a Countenance of

primitive Piety, or at least, so much of it, as his Eyes would permit, which still sparkled, and being fixed on the beautiful Part before-mention'd, spoke a Language truly Catholick.

JACK'S Mother was quite confounded at all these fine Words; and not perfectly understanding Logical Distinctions, was afraid the Holy Father was endeavouring to make her Proof against good or bad Fortune, not against good or bad Morals. Father Kelly soon solv'd her Doubts; for as the Child still continued at the Breast, he prais'd its Beauty, patted its Cheeks, and utter'd every infantine Expression, which Mothers are so naturally fond to hear.—The sweet little Fellow, said he, it looks like an Angel, I must kiss it, were it but for the Sake of the Nurse.—He kept his Word; but guiding his Head a little more on one Side, he feasted his Lips (as if by Accident) on those Charms his Eyes had been Witness of for half an Hour.
HIS Reverence recover'd himself at last, and—I ask your Pardon, good Mrs. Connor, said he, for by my own Conscience I had no Harm in my Thoughts; but God forgive me! in troth I was going to t'other Side, for fear it would be jealous; tho' if I had, you know, there would be no

Sin in it neither; for what is a Breast but Flesh? and so is your Hand; and what Sin, my Dear, in touching a Hand?
—This Reasoning was so strong that Conviction sat on Mrs. Connor's Countenance; which the good Man perceiving, he very fervently transported his Kisses from one Side to the other.

SOME Travellers appearing, and Jerry being summon'd to his Post, the charitable Priest slipt Sixpence into her Hand, and gave the old Man a Yard of good Tobacco; so wishing them good Luck, added his Benediction, and promis'd to call in his Walks.
IT would be endless to point out the Virtues of this good Man. He visited frequently, and always left something behind him. He mention'd to Dolly the most charitable Families in the Country; and taught Jerry how to tell the weary Traveller the Hour of the Day. He repair'd the first Hut, where she always cook'd the Victuals when he honour'd them with his Company. He put a Door to it, and sent in good Store of Whiskey and Straw, with two Cadows. This serv'd his Reverence for a Country Retreat; and answered every End of a Confessional. His Conversation was truly pious, and his Pains were great to convert Jerry to the

Bosom of that Church, out of which there is no Salvation. Sometimes, indeed, his Zeal was rather too great; for when Mr. Connor made strong Objections, he most charitably, and with a truly Christian Spirit, hurry'd poor Jerry's Soul to the Devil and all his Angels; in which Journey his Wife always added an hearty Amen.

ABOUT the Age of Five Years, JACK remembers his daily sitting on a Ditch with his Father and Mother, industriously employed in that most antient and most noble Profession of Begging. The Situation was well contriv'd, and three Roads terminated just at their Mansion, and, as it were, empty'd themselves into the great one. Besides the Beauty of the Prospect, I apprehend, his Parents had some Regard and Love to Society; for no Traveller could pass, but were attack'd with all the Oratory in their Power. Without Vanity I may say, few People of their Distinction enjoy'd that Talent to greater Perfection, especially Mrs. Connor. When she was determin'd to extract a Penny from a good Christian, she mounted the Ditch, and with Eyes rais'd to Heaven, and uplifted Hands, she bespoke his Favour: She saluted him with every tender, moving Expression. The Tear was ready; and sometimes she pleaded a

numerous Family of Orphans, and sometimes an antient helpless Husband.— Did his hard Heart pass by untouch'd, she followed him with her rais'd Voice, invoking every Saint to prosper his Journey, and to commiserate her wretched Condition.—Many a Time, and oft', has she compelled the most obdurate Lawyer or Parson to Rein-back, and fumble for Farthings.

JERRY had his Excellence: He was really advanced in Years; was infirm and blind. The Loss of Sight, so dreadful to many, was to them of infinite Use. From this he drew the Pity of the Good-natur'd, and the Compassion of most Travellers; but his being an old Soldier who had serv'd by Sea and Land, afforded an Addition to his Revenue; to which a red Coat contributed not a little.
YOUNG as our Hero was, his Employment had its Use; for whilst his dear Parents were solacing themselves in their Castle, and enjoying the Comforts of Ale, Tobacco, and the Conversation of Friends, he was on the Watch for the Approach of Passengers; when his Father or Mother, and sometimes both, sally'd out, and he always attended to join in the Cry and pick up the Copper that Humanity threw them.

JACK now grew a sturdy Fellow, of Six Years old. As his Mother had been so good to teach him to read, he was a great Comfort to his Father, and entertained him out of The whole Duty of Man, which he took particular Care of, ever since Mrs. Connor had sold his Bible. The Child read so frequently, that at last he was very expert, and began to relish the Subject. One Day, he asked his Father, If there was any more Books in the World, for he would read them all. 
God bless you, poor Child, said Jerry, and give you Grace to learn, and practice all good Things.—Then, folding him in his Arms, with many Tears, and uplifted Hands, beseech'd the Almighty to succour his helpless Age, and guide his Steps, that he might live by Honesty and Labour.—Though Jack knew not what he meant, yet his Words made so great an Impression, that he cry'd most heartily.— In this Situation the Mother found them, which soon changed the Scene: She storm'd like a Fury, and swore he was sending the Boy to the Devil, as well as himself; But, continued she, with all my Heart, an obstinate Bastard as he is; but I'll take Care, I warrant, of your damn'd Book.
—She then curs'd herself most bitterly, for teaching

Jack to read; and mutter'd something of sending him far enough out of his Reach.


No, Dolly, said her Husband, you need not do that; for Father Kelly and You will soon send me to my long Home!—'Tis too good News to be true,—said she.—Well, well, reply'd Jerry, I shan't trouble you long;— you may let me have a little Peace whilst I live.—Some Passengers interrupted this Conversation; and the common Occurrences of the Day, gave Jerry some Respite till Dinner.—He said Grace as usual, but could not eat. At Supper 'twas the same Way; and in the Night a Fever came on which open'd his Wounds, and, for Want of proper Care, a Mortification ensued, and the fourth Day he slept with his Fathers.—The pious Priest was determined to have the better of the Argument at last, and make him a good Catholick, by performing the final Rites of the Church, before the Body was quite cold.

ON this melancholy Occasion, it must be confessed, the poor Widow behav'd as the most fashionable of her Sex.—She shrieked and wrung her Hands, and call'd on Death to ease her Misery.—She fainted, and fell into Fits; and the Neighbours with great Difficulty brought her to herself.— When recover'd, she bore her Fate with

great Resignation, and gave Directions about the Funeral with much Composure of Mind, except when more Friends dropt in, which renewed her Sorrows; and then the whole Company sympathiz'd in the most doleful Cadences.

THE Deceased being stripped and washed, was laid out on some Straw, cover'd with a Sheet that was formerly white. On his Breast was a large Dish fill'd with Salt, which undoubtedly had its Use. The good People, three Miles round, flock'd to blind Connor's Wake, with Loads of Whiskey and Tobacco; Pipers were in Abundance; and sundry Gentlemen amused the Company with the sweet Harmony of their Trumps or Jews-harps.—When Father Kelly had declared that Jerry Connor died a True Son of the Church, being by him converted almost by a Miracle, a Buzz of Content ran thro' the whole Assembly, and he finished a few Prayers for the Repose of his Soul.

THE common Irish are chearful at a Wedding; but, at a Wake, their Joy and Mirth is seemingly extravagant. Ill Nature, and the Want of Compassion and Tenderness, are not placed amongst their natural Vices. If the Moral of this antient Custom be examined, and found to proceed from their Pleasure, in believing that their Friend or

Companion has quitted all human Infirmities, and now enjoys a Fulness of Bliss, we cannot think the Practice irrational or absurd.

MIRTH in every Shape abounded; but Jack seem'd to drop all the romping Sporters. He listened with great Attention to a Knot of Old Ladies, who entertained each other with true Stories of Giants and Witches, and Spirits, and Kings of Ireland.—From these he went to another Cluster, who spoke of the Deceased, like the Egyptian Priests. They magnify'd his supposed Virtues, and gave him Vices, to which he was a Stranger. —Scandal and Malice, and Envy, were present! Some hinted, that Dolly was not his Wife; some called her his Niece, and some his Daughter; but all agreed, in wondering, what he Devil Father Kelly could see, to make him so civil to her.—I much fear many grand Societies are but humble Imitators of this equally polite Assembly.
AT last the Funeral set out, directing their Course to a ruin'd Monastery, about Six Miles distant. The March was solemn; and ever and anon a Sacred Dirge was rais'd, that shook the Hills, and eccho'd through the Vales. The Company still encreas'd from the neighbouring Cabins, whose Inhabitants having walked two or three Miles, and rais'd their Notes of Condolence

with the rest; perhaps would at last find Time to ask, who is dead?

THE necessary Rites being finished, Mr. Kelly, with some of the Company, return'd to the Hut, where Jack soon found he wanted a Father, and had not a Mother.



CHAP. IV.


What by this Name, then, shall be understood?
What? but the glorious Lust of doing good?
The Heart that finds it Happiness to please,
Can feel another's Pain, and taste his Ease.
The Cheek that with another's Joy can glow,
Turn pale, and sicken, with another's Woe,
Free from Contempt and Envy, he who deems
Justly of Life's two opposite Extremes.
Who to make all, and each Man, truly blest,
Does all he can, and wishes all the rest.

FIELDING on Good Nature.


I May with Truth affirm, that Jack's Parents, tho' Beggars, gave better Education to their Son, than most of their Neighbours; witness his reading at so tender

an Age, when not one in a Thousand know a single Letter. His Dress was pretty much the same with young Gentlemen of his Years, or rather with almost all in the Parish. He had something on that resembled Breeches, and a Remnant of a Rug very artfully hung over his Shoulders, and fastened round his Waist by Pieces of Wood nicely carv'd, of the Size of a Packer's Needle.—A Shirt was an idle and uncomfortable Ornament; and Shoes and Stockings made Youth too tender and delicate. This noble and manly Dress is most carefully preserved; and scarcely has Novelty and Fashion found an Opportunity of making any Variations.—Tho' the Romans never visited Ireland, yet their Dress certainly did. Were our Virtuosi seriously to consider this, they might save the vast Expence they are at in purchasing a Piece of Leaden, or Marble, or Copper Roman Figure and Drapery; when, by stepping to Ireland, they may see Thousands, even at this Day, in the Original Habit, and whole Groups in the antient Manner, eating on the Ground.

PERHAPS I may be thought too free with so great a Name as LOCKE, when I say I imagine he borrows Part of his Treatise on Education from this People, to whom, I've been told, he was no Stranger. All

the World knew that the common Romans wore no Shoes; but Mr. Locke could not infer from thence, with all his more than Human Understanding, that going without them, or having the Feet constantly wet, was conducive to Health or Vigour, till he saw such numberless Examples.—But to return to the Family.
FATHER KELLY'S Visits to the Widow were more frequent than usual, as she stood in Need of more frequent Consolation. From his pious Intentions the evil-minded of the Parish drew Conclusions no-way favourable to either, especially as Mrs. Connor dropt her former Occupation, and retir'd to the first Hut, where she suffer'd herself to be visited but by a few select Friends; and was never publickly seen but at Mass.—How different! How chang'd in her Appearance! Her Face was wash'd; —her fine black Hair was comb'd, and nicely plaited;—her Kercher was clean, which passing under her Chin, was neatly ty'd at the back of her Neck;—her brown Jacket with red Cuffs;—her red Petticoat, and, above all, her yellow Stockings and new Brogues drew the Eyes of the whole Congregation; some to admire her real Comeliness, but more to whisper, They wished she came honestly by them.


WHATEVER were their private Opinions, Father Kelly received many publick Marks of their Dis-esteem. The old Ladies, and the young, extreamly resented this open and particular Attachment, so injurious to their own Beauties and superior Merit. They wrought on their Husbands, their Brothers and Sweethearts; and the good and charitable Priest was condemn'd a Sacrifice to Malice and Envy.

WHETHER the People had just Cause to complain to the titular Archbishop of Cashel, or whether Father Kelly and Mrs. Connor were conscious of Guilt; or, whether they found the Current of Slander too strong to stem, I know not; neither can I tell the Resolution they took on this Occasion, but certain it is, they came to one very speedily.
MRS. CONNOR had converted the old red Coat into a Sort of Waistcoat for Jack, who having a Pocket, never failed carrying his Book in it. One Morning she called him up earlier than usual, and with more than common good Humour, wash'd his Face and comb'd his Head, and having put on something like a Shirt, she kiss'd him, saying, 'he was a charming pretty Boy.' In Reality he was so.—Come, Jack, says she, now we'll walk to Town and see your

Aunt.—Poor Jack was vastly pleas'd at going to Town, though he knew not where, and followed his Mother with great Chearfulness. They had not walk'd above a Mile or two, when a Man overtook them, whom Mrs. Connor knew. Some Questions being ask'd, I am going, said she, to leave Jack at my Sister's for a Day or two, and must be back to Squire Disney's to Night. —That's too far, said the Man, to walk in one Day; go you to the Squire's, and I shall take care of Jack.
—The Child cry'd, but his Mother coax'd, and prevail'd on him to go without Murmuring. She kiss'd, and promising to see him To-morrow, turn'd about, and Jack and the Stranger marched on.
NOTHING remarkable happened in this Journey, but Jack complain'd that the Town was a great ways off.—That he wish'd he was there;—that he was Hungry, or Dry, or Sleepy, and some childish Talk of that Sort, to which the Man gave Answers, and relieved all his Wants.—Many Days passed in small Journeys, till the Fellow found he was in the County of Meath. He fed the Child as well as he could, and having got a Woman to wash his Rags and clean him, march'd on till he came to a large fine House.—Now, Jack, said he,

we shall soon see your Aunt; stay here, my good Child, a little, and I'll be with you by and by; but be sure don't go beyond that great Gate.
(Pointing to the Gate of the House.) The Man walk'd off, and Jack never saw him after.
THE poor Child waited a long Time for him with great Patience, till Hunger and Night coming on, he cry'd till his little Heart was almost broke.—At last he ventured to walk to the Gate, and found it open. He went into a large Court-yard, and finding a House, which was a deserted Dog-kennel, he boldly enter'd; and what with his Fatigues, and little Sorrows, he lay down and slept soundly 'till next Morning.—One of the Grooms going by, heard the Cries of the Boy, and relieved him from his Prison.—He was ask'd many Questions, to which he could give no Answers; except that a Man was going with him to his Aunt's, and that his Name was Jack Connor.—The Groom ask'd him if he was hungry? Yes, said Jack, and very dry too, and my Feet are very sore.
— The Servant was good natur'd, and taking him into one of the Stables, gave him a Piece of Bread and some small Beer. He wash'd his little Feet with warm Brand and Water, which was ready to be given to a

sick Horse, and laid him on some clean Straw. The poor Child went to Sleep, but waken'd so refresh'd, and so happy, that, on seeing the Groom, he smil'd, and utter'd every Expression, that shew'd the Gratitude of his Heart.
THUS was he fed for a Fortnight, and all Enquiry was made by the Servants about him, but in vain.—Jack grew quite well, and mightily pleas'd with his Situation, for Providence had directed him to the House of LORD TRUEGOOD, a Nobleman less remarkable for his large Fortune, than his Humanity, and extensive Charity to all Mankind.
MR. KINDLY, his Lordship's Domestick Steward, had heard something of this Story, and determined to see the Child.— He watch'd when the Servants were out, and stole privately into the Stable.—Jack was mounted in one of the Windows, with his Book in his Hand, but when he saw the Gentleman, he stuff'd it into his Pocket, and got on his Feet in an Instant. Mr. Kindly, with a Smile of good Nature, cry'd out—'Who have we got here?—Where did you come from, Child?'—'Indeed, Sir, reply'd Jack, almost in Tears, I don't know.'—'Don't cry, my Dear, said the good Steward, I shall do you no Harm;

—Have you a Mother, and where is she gone to?—I don't know indeed Sir, reply'd Jack, but she gave me to a Man to see my Aunt, and he bid me stay at the Gate, and so I did, and so he did'nt come for me.'—'That's my good Boy, said Kindly; come, now tell me all the rest.'—The poor Child was not at a Loss, but told as much of his Affairs as he possibly could know, and in so innocent a Manner, that greatly pleas'd the good Man. —That's my good Dear, said he; but what Book was it, you put in your Pocket? Let me see it my Man.—Jack deliver'd it, telling him, his Father said it was a good Book, and would make every Body good.—Mr. Kindly look'd at the Title, and was greatly surpriz'd.—'Your Father, said he, was a good Man, and you'll be a very good Boy, when you can read it.'— Oh dear, said Jack, indeed, Sir, I can read it very well.'—'Can you so, reply'd the Steward, let me see.'—He opened the Book, where least mark'd, and Jack began, and pretty distinctly read.—So also for the Calamities and Miseries that befall a Man, be it Want or Sickness, or whatever else, these also come by the Providence of God, who raiseth up and putteth down, as seems good to him, and it belongs not to us

to judge what are the Motives to him to do so, as many do, who, upon any Affliction that befalls another, are presently concluding, that sure it was some extraordinary Guilt, which puts this upon him, though they have no particular to lay to his Charge.—As the Boy read, the Tenderness of the good Man mounted to his Eyes.—That's enough my Child, said he,—God bless you.—So quitting him in an Instant, got into the Yard, and gave vent to a few Tears.—Good God, cry'd he, how infinitely is thy loving Kindness, who, out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings, teacheth us our Duty.

MR. KINDLY walked to the House, and having call'd Mrs. Mathews, an elderly Servant, begg'd her to get him a Leg or a Wing of a Fowl, with a Piece of Bread, and some small Beer. 'Lord, dear Sir, said Mrs. Mathews, may hap your Morning's Walk has gotten you a Stomach; pray let me broil you a Pigeon, and give you a Glass of white Wine.'—'Thank you heartily, good Mrs. Mathews, reply'd the Steward, you know I seldom eat in a Morning, but I never drink. What I want is for a poor Stranger.'— Lord bless you, dear Sir, said Mrs. Mathews, you are so good, all the Servants

are bound to pray for you.'—She did not wait for a Reply, but ran to the Pantry, and soon returned, properly loaded. — 'Thank you, my dear Friend, said Mr. Kindly, now I have a great Favour to beg of you; which is, to carry these to the farthest Stable, where you'll find a poor little Boy. See him eat his Dinner, and take him to John Long's Wife.'—'Yes that I will, said she.'—'The Lord preserve your good Heart.—I'm sure you're always the poor Man's Friend. — The Lord keep you your Health, for you're too good for this World.'—'We must assist one another, said Kindly, but pray go and help the Child, and I'll walk on to John Long's.'
MRS. MATHEWS thought there was some Mystery in this Affair, but resolved to hear and see, but say nothing. She determined to be as secret as could be expected from her Sex and Station; so, wisely took Jenny the House Maid to the Stable, to whom she communicated the Matter, with many notable Remarks.—You know, Jenny, said she, Mr. Kindly is a Man as well as another, and though he is antient or so, yet, let me tell you, 'tis an old Rat that won't eat Cheese.—He's a hearty Man, Jenny, and a good natur'd Man, and they

say lives a Widower for the Sake of his Children; now putting Things and Things together, who knows what may have happen'd?—But please God it shall go no farther for me;'—nor for me neither, said Jenny, for I would not hurt a Hair of his Head, poor dear Man.


THEY got to the Stable and found Jack with the Groom.—So so, said Mrs. Mathews, have I found you, young Spark.— 'Come, sit down my little fellow, and try how a bit will agree with you.'—'What Jenny, said the Groom, are you come too? I'll say that for you, you've as good a Nose at finding out a pretty Boy, as any Wench in the Parish; I suppose he's some Relation of your's, Eh, Jenny?— The Fellow's a Fool, said Mrs. Mathews, tho' may hap he may have as good Relations as any here.—Come, my brave Man, eat heartily, and much good may do you.—So—you say your Name is Jack,—'Yes, Madam, said the Child, my Name is Jack Connor.—Very well, said the good Woman, very well; now come, my dear, and take a Walk with me, we'll not go far, only to John Long's.' —Then turning to the Groom, said, with a Wink, Mr. Kindly bid me fill his little Belly, and carry him to John's Wife.


THE Groom was pleas'd, and the Ladies marched on.—'Jenny, said Mrs. Mathews, look at the little Fellow, how sturdily he walks, and for all the World, like good Mr. Kindly. 'Faith and troth, said Jenny, and so he does, and his Name is Jack too.' 'Faith, said Mrs. Mathews, I forgot that, and then the little Rogue has the very Smile of him.—Now I think on it Jenny, I'll be hang'd but I knew the Mother of him. Do you remember Bryan Connor the Miller, that lived at the Ford two Miles off.'—'Yes that I do, reply'd Jenny, and by the same Token, he had four Daughters and three Sons.'— Very true, said Mrs. Methews, and all the Neighbours believed Mr. Kindly was a great Help to the Family, for he went very often there. The old People died, and the Children went up and down, I don't know what became of them all; but Molly Connor was a pretty Hussey enough, but was no better than she should be, and about seven or eight Years agon, she contriv'd to get her Belly up, and then went to Dublin.'—'Goodness Sirs, said Jenny, how strangely Things comes about; so, to be sure this is her Child.' Ay, ay, said Mathews, as sure as I'm in this Spot alive. Murder will out, you know,

but that's none of our Business,—we are only Servants, and must hold our Tongues; so, besure Jenny, said she, don't open your Lips about it, for it shan't be computed to me, for I hate fending and proving, and wou'd'nt be brought into a Primeiniron for all I'm worth in the World.'

THE Steward and Mrs. Long were waiting at the Door till Jack arrived.— There, Madam Long, said Mr. Kindly, There's a Boy for you; don't you think him very like me? Heaven knows, reply'd Mrs. Long, for the poor little Face of him is so dirty, 'tis impossible to tell who he is like; but please God, I'll know more of him by To-morrow! Do so, said Kindly, and in a little Time I hope to see him look as well as my own Son.— Then turning to Mrs. Mathews, thank'd her for her Civilities, and promis'd her a Present of some good Bohea Tea.


THE Ladies made great haste Home, and by Mr. Kindly's Words, they were more confirm'd in their first Conjectures, and in the Necessity of being very Secret.— No doubt they were mighty cautious, but on Mr. Kindly's Return to Bounty-Hall, he found a strange Alteration in the Countenances of the Servants.—When he spoke,

he was answer'd with a Smile or a Grin.— A general Titter and Whisper ran through the Family, and on his Enquiry into the Cause of so much Mirth, they vanish'd with a loud Laugh.—Though a little surpriz'd at their Behaviour, he knew there was no Mischief done, so was perfectly easy. He always permitted them to be as chearful as they pleas'd, for he thought an Openness and Freedom of Manners, was an Indication of an honest Heart; but he ever suspected a Servant of a gloomy or sullen Countenance.


CHAP. V.


There is a Lust in Man no Charm can tame,
Of loudly publishing his Neighbour's Shame:
On Eagles Wings immortal Scandals fly,
While virtuous Actions are but born and die.


HARVEY'S JUVENAL.



A SECRET, like many other Disorders, is Epidemical and Contagious, but in the whole History of Physick, none is more Instant, or whose Quality is more Diffusive. —Every Part of human Matter is immediately affected, and the first Symptom, most

commonly appears on the Tongue. To curious Persons, this Malady would afford an Infinity of Observations.—Where a Secret takes its Rise from Charity, Good-nature, Friendship, Benevolence, or other remarkable Virtues, be assured the Disorder is not of long Continuance. It attacks us, and we must be a little sensible of its Power, but it soon flies off by the Operation of the Lips.—Some have been cured by saying, I never thought him that Sort of Man.—He's a great Cheat, if what you say be true.— That may be, but to be sure, he had his Ends in it.—I find Miracles are not ceas'd.—I've a little of the THOMAS in me—and so on.— Against this Sort of Pestilence, the Bishop need never order public Prayers; for when it happens, it seldom goes beyond the Neighbourhood, but never marches to the next Parish.

ON the other Hand, when the Plague of Secrecy has its Source from Scandal, Malice, Envy, and sometimes, mere Ignorance, the Effects are astonishing. Every Breast is enflam'd, and the Fire communicates itself like Electricity. The Heart swells, and the Tongue, with loud Clamour, utters Millions of Falsehoods.—The farther the Contagion spreads, the Disorder encreases its Force, nor does it stop, till it encounters some new Frenzy or Secret.


THOUGH the learned Dr. Mead has been silent on this Article, yet it certainly is of as subtil and poisonous a Nature, as any mentioned in his History.—Indeed it seldom carries its baneful Influence to the Life of the Person pointed at, but it violently attacks, and often destroys the Reputation, the Bread, the Peace and Happiness of whole Families. The Doctor may cure th'enraged Mastiff's Bite; but who can heal the Wounds that Slanderers Tongues have made? —Dr. Monroe, is a Stranger to this Species of Madness, nor did I ever hear that Mr. Ward has attempted to palliate it. If 'tis not in Physick to relieve this dreadful Malady, what Prayers should we not offer up, to avert the Evil!

DO thou therefore, kind Reader, give up thy Neighbour or thy Friend, who labours under this Madness.—Avoid him; —his Breath is Infectious, and the Saliva of his Tongue, will destroy thy Peace.—Listen not to his Words, neither repeat them.—Be firm in Truth, and the Pest may escape thee, and perhaps, in Time, the Name of the Malady may be lost.
BUT to return.—The mighty Secret was now in the Possession of every Servant, mounting by Degrees, till it arrived to Mrs. Betty Tittle, Lady Truegood's Woman;

who, like a good Christian, suffer'd not the Sun to go down, till she imparted the valuable Discovery to her Ladyship.—'Tittle, said her Ladyship, I can't imagine what ails the Servants: Surely something must have vastly pleas'd them, they seem so merry!—Tittle put her Handkerchief to her Face to hide her Blushes.'—'Pray, said my Lady, what is the Matter?—I suppose some Maid has got a Sweetheart, or stolen a Wedding, or some such Thing.' —'No indeed, Mem, said Tittle, I assure your Laship, there's nothing like a Wedding in the Case.'—'I hope, reply'd my Lady, there is nothing worse, though you are all too apt to laugh at Mischief; but whatever it is, I insist Mrs. Tittle, you'll instantly tell me.—Lord Mem, said Tittle, I don't know how to speak of naughty Things, especially to your Laship; but all the Servants knows as well as I, for Mrs. Mathews and Jenny told me of it, and they went to see the Child.'— Child! cry'd my Lady, greatly alarm'd, what Child.'—I once more desire, and I lay my Commands on you, to tell me the whole Story this Moment.'—'I hope, said Tittle, your Laship won't be angry with me; but 'tis only, please your Laship, that Molly Connor, the Miller's

Daughter, made Mr. Kindly a Present of a fine Boy this Morning. The Nurse brought it Home, because Mr. Kindly would not pay for its Keeping this four or five Years, so the poor Man was forced to take the Child, and send it to John Long's; and indeed, please your Laship, that's all, only they say, that the Boy is seven or eight Years old, and as like Mr. Kindly as two Peas; but they say Mem.— Hold your impertinent Tongue, said my Lady, is this the Occasion of so much Giggle?—You are an ungrateful Pack. I am sure 'tis false, therefore I charge you all, not to appear before me with such saucy Airs.'—'Indeed Mem, said Tittle, if I've said any thing to offend your Laship.—Yes, Madam, said my Lady, you have very greatly offended me, and so you have all; but hold your scandalous Tongue, and leave me this Minute.'
POOR Mrs. Tittle was not only vastly disappointed, but greatly frighten'd, as she had never heard her Ladyship speak in such a Manner, or seem in such a Passion.—She inform'd the rest, of the Reception she met with; and the Faces of the Servants seem'd more compos'd at Supper. They were quite surpriz'd at the Oddity of her Ladyship's Temper, and quoted many Examples

diametrically opposite.'—I'm sure, said Mrs. Tittle, had I told as much to Squire Smart's Lady, we should have laugh'd together about it, the whole live long Night!—Ay, ay, said Mrs. Mathews, God bless the good Lady Malign. When I waited on her in Yorkshire, many a Gown and Petticoat, and Smock, have I gotten for telling her half as much; but to be sure some People think themselves wiser than all the World.'—'Hold, hold, said Tom Blunt the Butler; 'Now d'ye see, if so be that as how, my Lady is wrong, she'll do you Right; and if my Lady is right, how like Fools and Ninni-hammers will you all look? So d'ye see, take a Fool's Advice, and go and sleep upon't.—Tom went to Bed, and as he left them no more to say, we may suppose they follow'd his Example.

MY Lord and Lady were now retir'd, when she reveal'd to him with an Air of Concern and Emotion, what Mrs. Tittle had told her, every now and then asking his Advice and Opinion.—'My dear Betty, reply'd my Lord, don't be uneasy; I've heard of this Affair pretty much in the same Manner. I've privately examin'd into it, and have great Reason to applaud Mr. Kindly's Conduct. As you always

judge right, I am not surpriz'd at your checking the Tattling of Servants, which, if once encourag'd, as ignorant People too frequently do, 'tis impossible to say where it may end: However, continued his Lordship, as trifling as this Affair is, I hope to make it useful. When I bring it on the Carpet; I must beg your Asistance.'—'My dear Harry, said my Lady, I shall not fail; but come to Bed, and if you think proper, tell me then all the rest.'
THE Curtains were drawn, but, as nothing of the Conversation transpir'd, I cannot draw this Chapter to a greater Length.



CHAP. VI.


Hail wedded Love! mysterious Law! true Source
Of Human Off-spring! sole Propriety
In Paradise, of all Things common else!
By thee adult'rous Lust was driv'n from Man
Among the Bestial Herds to range: By thee,
Founded in Reason, loyal, just, and pure,
Relations dear, and all the Charities
Of Father, Son, and Brother, first were known!

MILTON.



AS the Reader must reside with Lord and Lady Truegood for some Time, perhaps they will be pleas'd at being properly acquainted with them. To those who know not their Persons, I can only introduce them to their Personal Conduct, and Family Behaviour. This may be as useful and entertaining, and rather less tedious, than a Description of their Features, their Stature, or other visible Marks of Elegance, Beauty, or Deformity.


HIS Lordship had about Five Thousand a Year in Ireland, and about Two Thousand in England, all in his own Power. Her Ladyship was the Daughter of Sir William Templeton, of Lancashire. She was Heiress to Two Thousand Pounds a Year in that County; and his Lordship's Estate lay contiguous to it. Miss Templeton was endow'd with all those Charms that Men of Sense admire, because they know they are lasting. Her Wit and Knowledge had that Sort of sprightly and solid Turn, that enliven'd, at the same Time, it pleas'd and improv'd her Hearers. Her many Virtues were more admir'd than imitated; and her Person, tho' not a Beauty, was so genteel and elegantly neat, that she rais'd Desire in every Breast, and commanded more than common Respect. They had been well acquainted when Children; and from the Intimacy of each Family, a Friendship, if not something stronger, insensibly grew up with them. His Collegiate Studies being over, and his Father dead, he was sent to finish the Accomplishments of a Gentleman by Travel. In this Time he constantly corresponded with Miss Betty Templeton, and the most agreeable and entertaining Letters pass'd, greatly to their Satisfaction and mutual Improvement. Mr. Johnston,

a Clergyman, and his Lordship's Tutor and Companion, vastly encourag'd these good Dispositions in his Pupil, foreseeing the happy Consequences that might arise from it.
AT Twenty-four Years of Age, his Lordship return'd from his Travels, a truly polite, and well-bred Man.—He found Miss Templeton, now about Nineteen Years of Age, with every Qualification he could wish in a Wife.—He spoke to her, at some Distance, on that Head, and found her Answers sensible and just, and no-ways against his Views.—His Lordship, then, apply'd to Mrs. Jordon, a Widow Lady, and Aunt to Miss, who had bred her from a Child, and supply'd the Loss of a Mother. The good Lady was overjoy'd to put her dear Niece into the Hands of a Nobleman of such Fortune; and whose great Good-nature, and many Virtues, promis'd a Life of real Happiness and Content.
HIS Lordship now paid his Addresses publickly; every one agreeing, they were born for each other.—A Jointure was soon fix'd on; but the Settling his Estate was a Matter of some Difficulty, as his Notions on that Head were uncommon.—He always thought, that the Undutifulness of

Children to their Parents, especially of the Eldest Son, proceeded often from a Knowledge of the Fortune they were entitled to, at their Father's Decease.—His Lordship convinced the young Lady of the Absurdity of placing Children out of the Power of Parents, either to reward some for their Goodness, or chastise others for their Misdeeds. At last he perswaded her Guardians, and Four Thousand Pounds a Year was settled on the Issue of the Marriage, in such Proportion, as my Lord thought proper to make by Will, or any future Deed or Gift, except an Estate of Five Hundred Pounds a Year, which should follow the Title: Two Thousand Pounds a Year, and Ten Thousand Pounds in Money, was settled on Miss Templeton; and my Lord reserv'd the Remainder as a Settlement on any future Wife, or to be disposed of, as he thought proper. —The young Lady was so weak, that she absolutely insisted, that Pin, or Alimony, should not be mentioned in any of the Writings.—All these Matters being regularly adjusted, the Day was fix'd, and Mr. Johnston joyn'd their Hands, and compleated the Happiness of this truly affectionate Pair.
MY Lord and Lady stay'd above Two Years in England; but finding his Presence

quite necessary in Ireland, to settle his Fortune, which had somewhat suffer'd by the Death of his Father, and his own long Absence, he hasten'd over, and determin'd chiefly to reside there.—He took with him his two Sons, Henry and William, with my Lady's Aunt, Mrs. Jordon, and a numerous Retinue of Servants.—Mr. Johnston had been already there Twelve Months, and settled in a good Living, which my Lord had procured him.
BOUNTY-HALL, the Seat of Lord True-good, was a regular, well-built House, tho' not altogether in the Modern Taste.—The Company, to congratulate my Lord and Lady on their safe Arrival, was very numerous and very gay. They seem'd free, and of chearful Dispositions, inviting my Lord and Family to their Houses, in such an hearty sincere Manner, as quite pleas'd and surpriz'd my Lady and Mrs. Jordon, who were not a little prejudiced against the Irish. —Mrs. Jordon could not avoid telling my Lord, she lik'd them extreamly, but wish'd they'd speak with another Tone of Voice.— My Lord laugh'd, and said, I assure you, one of the Ladies ask'd me, if all the English spoke in so strange a Manner as Mrs. Jordon? But she added, she believ'd you were a very good Lady, for all that.

—My Lady and her Aunt smil'd, and took this tender Rebuke in the proper Manner; acknowledging, that Infant Prejudices were difficult to remove, but hoped, Time would get the better of some of them.
MRS. JORDON took great Pains to reform the Pronunciation of the People. She made such Progress in transplanting the Lancashire Dialect, that on her Return to that County, she was heartily laugh'd at, and by her Friends was constantly called an Irish Bog-Trotter,—a Brogue-a-neer,—a Teague, and sundry other endearing Names. —But I must follow my Lord.
HIS first Care was to get out of the Hands of the Lawyers, for he had three Chancery Suits: Two of them he soon finished in an amicable Manner, but the Third was so glaring an Affront on his Understanding and his Right, that he would hear of no Composition, lest he might be tax'd with Weakness, and draw on himself others.— This determin'd him to prosecute the Suit with the utmost Vigour; and the Expedition of the Law was such, that the Cause was ripe for an Hearing, just as my Lord— became a Grandfather.

WHILST his Law Affairs were put in a Channel, he at the same Time settled with his different Receivers, two of whom he

discharged, as likewise his Auditor, taking that Branch into his own Management. He oblig'd his Receivers to return him Monthly Abstracts of their Receipts and Payments, by which he was enabled to settle each Tenant's Account, and at one View, knew their Arrear, and gave Orders for Severity or Indulgence, as the Circumstances required.
As my Lord's chief Residence was in the Country, he saw, with real Uneasiness, the wretched Condition of the poor Inhabitants. Their Idleness and Sloth, with the Swarms of ignorant Priests, and the Treatment of some Landlords, kept them in a constant miserable Situation, and even depriv'd them of sufficient Spirits to wish a Change of Condition. My Lord clearly saw, that such Dispositions could never improve the Face of the Country. He considered, that the People, however poor and miserable, were by Nature, strong; and, when set on by Example and Encouragement, were not the least Docile of all Nations. These Sort of Reflections, as a faithful and good Subject, engrossed his whole Thoughts. He knew, that the Strength of the Crown, was in the Number of faithful Inhabitants; and, to reclaim those who were otherwise, was a

Duty worthy the Attention of every Man who lov'd the King or his own Happiness.

AT a Meeting of the Justices of the Peace for the County, his Lordship very pathetically laid before them, what Popery was productive of, in a Protestant Government; or, as it is elegantly express'd by the brightest Genius of the Age,The EARL of CHESTERFIELD'S Speech to the PARLIAMENT of IRELAND.

That the speculative Errors (of POPERY) would only deserve Pity, if their pernicious Influence upon CIVIL SOCIETY did not both REQUIRE and AUTHORIZE Restraint. That the Laws against Papists, tho' severe in the Letter, and tho' mostly taken from the Edicts of France against Hugonots, but greatly soften'd, were connived at, and, in a great Measure, made useless.—That the Condition of the poorer Sort in Ireland, was a Scandal to a Nation who piqued themselves at being Polite and Humane, and almost compell'd the few Strangers who visited the Country, to imagine they were rather with the Natives of the Cape of Good Hope, than in a civilized Kingdom.—That as natural Justice and Tenderness obliged us to indulge them with a Priest in each Parish; yet Justice and Tenderness to ourselves,

ought to oblige us to prosecute every Interloper who attempted to officiate.—He added, that he was so convinced of the Necessity of it, he was determin'd to begin in his own District, and wish'd every one present would concur with him.
MANY Debates arose: but the chief Opposition was from tender Minds, who fear'd such a Conduct would be call'd a Persecution. One of the Gentlemen answer'd, he did not doubt, but Popery would blacken it with every odious Name.—That whatever was the Practice of other Nations, he was far from Oppressing or Forcing the Wills or Consciences of Men in religious Matters.— That the present Debate was not so much levell'd at their Religion, as the preventing the Ignorant being deceived and impoverished by those who pretended to the Name of it—as in the Case of Gypsies and Fortune-tellers, who rob the Weak, where a Justice of the Peace may, and ought, to send them to the House of Correction, if not to the Plantations.—That the Maxim was perfectly true, in Regard to Ireland, that Ignorance was the Mother of Devotion; and that, were it possible to give the poor Natives a little Learning, they would be Honester, more Industrious, and in Time, find out how grosly they were deceived.

MUCH more was said on the Occasion, and all agreed to do their utmost for the Relief of the Poor, in Respect to Supernumerary Priests, and in every other Way for the General Good.—A few Examples being made, obliged those Holy Nusances to shift their Abode, and fly to a County in the West, where One or Two Hundred extraordinary, were little regarded; and where Fryaries are common, and Nunneries more open, than at Hammersmith near London.

THAT the poorer Sort might not want Examples of Industry to spur them on, my Lord annually settled two or three poor Lancashire Families on the Home Estate. He built them decent Dwellings, and lett them proper Farms. The more Children they had, his private Encouragement was the greater.
HIS happy Imagination suggested to him a Scheme, productive of more Good, than was at first thought on.—He gave out, that in Compassion to the Poor of the Parish, he would take and maintain Ten Boys, not older than Twelve, or younger than Seven Years of Age, and have them taught some Trade or Business, that they might earn their Bread in an honest Way. The poor People press'd their Children on him with such Eagerness, that he might have had an Hundred.

His Number was fix'd for Boys; but he permitted my Lady to add Ten Girls to his Plan. For these he built a convenient House; maintain'd, and uniformly cloath'd, and fix'd a Protestant Family from the North, to teach them two Hours a Day to Read, and the Remainder, in such Branches of the Linen Manufacture, as their Age would admit of.
MY Lord made Regulations as he saw convenient. The Progress they made gave him vast Pleasure, and her Ladyship a rational Amusement, as she frequently visited the Children, and heard them say their Prayers and Catechism, and encouraged them in their Work. In a little Time they were able to join in the Psalms on Sundays, and their Voices were a great Addition to the Service in a Country Church. Some few Attempts were made to pervert the Children, and make them return to their Parents, and consequently to Sloth, Ignorance and Filth, but the Actors were soon oblig'd to quit the Country, and they were found to be Popish School-Masters, who, generally speaking, are Priests in Disguise.
FROM this Hint, so self evidently advantageous to the Kingdom, and from the Bounty and infinite Labours of a truly RIGHT REVEREND PRELATE, sprung those

Schools of Industry, now known by the Name of the Incoporated Society, for promoting English Protestant Schools in Ireland. The Application of the first Subscription had so good an Effect, that HIS MAJESTY supported the Scheme by a Royal Charter; and encouraged the Spreading these Schools over Ireland, by a Grant of One Thousand Pounds a Year. This, with the annual Bounties, and casual Legacies from both Kingdoms, have enabled the Trustees to extend their Views, and make the Charity more General. A Charity! where not a single Instance of Misapplication can be given. A Charity unparallell'd! and for which the next Generation must Bless the Promoters, as they must feel the happy Consequences.
FOR fuller Particulars of this noble Charity, I must refer my kind Readers to the annual Accounts publish'd in Ireland, and by their Correspondent Society in London. When they examine and seriously consider it, if they have Hearts, they must rejoice.
BUT to return to my Lord.—Though Part of his Time was given to the Publick, his private Affairs were not neglected. He employ'd the Poor, which is the best Sort of Charity, in draining and making good Land of some Bogs. He planted Trees of

all Sorts. He mended and shortened the Roads; and, in a Word, he contrived, and spared no Expence in executing, what he judg'd of Publick Utility.


CHAP. VII.


Children like tender Oziers, take the Bow,
And as they first are fashion'd always grow:
For what we learn in Youth, to that alone
In Age we are by second Nature prone.

DRYDEN.



THOUGH his Lordship had began and forwarded these great Works, he attended the British Parliament three Winters, as a Member of the House of Commons. He thought himself ill us'd at a new Election, and declined engaging too far, lest it might frustrate his future Views. In some Disgust at the Treatment he had met with, he return'd to Ireland.

His Son HENRY was now about Five, WILLIAM, Four, and his Daughter HARRIOT, Three Years of Age. These began to demand his particular Attention. Her Ladyship was an uncommon Mother, for she had not only taught them what their

Age was capable of; but had most prudently prevented their being taught sundry bad Habits, which might never be thoroughly erased. Scarcely were any of her Children able to walk, when she took Opportunities of sending them into the next Room at Night without a Candle; and as they grew up, she found Reasons to oblige them to go over the whole House in the same Manner, neither did she ever permit a Servant to stay with them, or a Candle to burn in the Room, when they were put to Bed. No Nurse or Domestick, durst venture to mention a single Word, or idle Story that could inspire Fear into the Minds of the Children, except they chose their immediate Discharge, which happened twice or thrice.—By this Method they had no Notion of imaginary Dangers, which saved them many uneasy Hours in their Lives, which others feel for Want of such a Management.

THEIR little Learning was not inculcated by the common Means of Obligation and Duty. If my Lord gave them Halfpence, and they listen'd to the Story of a poor Person, and relieved him, he was in great Delight.—When he had mentioned all the Blessings attending a Charitable and Compassionate Temper; he'd turn to my Lady,

and say, My Dear, the Children have been very good, and I desire you will love and encourage them, and give them Leave to learn as much as they please.'— To this my Lady answer'd, 'Because they have so much Sense as to oblige you, I will take that Trouble on myself.

ON the contrary, was any one of them guilty of a Fault, the highest Correction was, being depriv'd of their Book, refused being taught their Lesson, and not regarded in the usual Manner. On these Occasions, the poor Delinquent was oblig'd to make his Peace, and enter into Grace, by Prayer, Repentance, and double Diligence; yet still, this Matter was so contrived, that no Jealousy could arise amongst them. The Good were suffered to pity the Faulty, and intercede for them; and, after the necessary Difficulties, always succeeded. Often have they requested, and even supplicated her Ladyship to teach them, and she often refus'd, as what gave her too much Pain, or, having other Matters to mind of more Consequence: However, she commonly suffer'd herself to be prevail'd on at last.
WHATEVER some may imagine, there is certainly an Activity or Impulse in the Soul, that gives it a Desire and Longing for those Things that are attainable but by Difficulty

and Labour; and a Disregard, and sometimes, a Loathing even of our real Happiness or Pleasure, when, in a Manner, they are forced on us, or too cheaply purchased. Whether this arises from the Obstinacy or Perverseness of our Nature; or, is given to convince us, that the Love of Freedom is strongly implanted in our Breasts; or whether for the wise End of employing the Mind, in searching after, and surmounting Difficulties, and to raise in us the Spirit of Emulation and proper Ambition, so absolutely necessary to Mankind, I shall not determine, as it is out of my Province; but I can safely say, that whether this Principle springs from a Defect or Perfection in our Nature; these Parents chang'd the strong Bias, if the First, and cultivated and greatly improved it, if the Latter;—if a Defect, their Manner is still more Praise-worthy, as they made it answer all the Ends of a Perfection.—The same Scheme, varied in Proportion as Age open'd their Minds, was constantly pursued in their Education, and the Lessons and Customs that were sown, and had taken Root in their Childhood, grew up insensibly into Habits with their Years, and became Constitutional.

PRIDE, another Attendant on our Frame, was to be encounter'd and conquer'd by

my Lord.—As the little ones were, what is commonly call'd, fine Children, Care was taken to prevent their having too good an Opinion of their Persons.—The Servants had particular Instructions on that Head; nor could they, without greatly disobliging my Lord, praise a Child for its beautiful Face, Skin, or the like. Even the Visitors were privately requested to avoid any Applause of that Sort; but when some began to extol, my Lord or Lady always drew back the Flattery, by assuring the Person, that all the Merit Harry had, was his being a good Boy; did what he was bid, said his Prayers, and thank'd God that he had given him all his Limbs, and not made him crooked or deform'd, like many poor Children.
IF my Lady caught Miss looking too frequently in the Glass, and seemingly admiring her Features, she order'd a beautiful China Figure to be brought, and desiring her to observe its Complexion, its Eyes, its Teeth, &amp;c. would add,—Perhaps this fine Lady is as fond of her dear Person as other Folks, and indeed I think, with as good Reason; for, do you know, my dear Harriot, what this pretty Thing is made of?—I assure you, 'tis of dirty Earth, just like you or me; so you may

well imagine this Lump of Clay has great Reason to value itself, when in an Instant, if I think proper, I can brake it into a Thousand Pieces, and make it Dirt again.'—Here, said she to a Servant, 'take this Thing away, it seems too much pleas'd with itself, to please me, or any body else.—There needed no more to persuade Miss Harriot to retire from the Mirror, asham'd of herself and of the Comparison.
WHEN the Business of their Book, which was always a voluntary Duty, or rather a Pleasure, was over, they were indulged in every Amusement, and not kept up in warm Rooms, to weaken their Sinews and enfeeble their Constitutions. The Boys were permitted to ramble in the Fields with a careful Servant or two, and use as much Exercise as they pleased, and their being dirty or wet on those Occasions, was never counted a Fault.—Sometimes my Lord and Lady were vastly amus'd, in entering into the Spirit of their Plays, and my Lord tumbled about the Room and join'd in their Mirth and Pastime. By this Means, the Children were never happier than when with them. They seem'd like Companions and Friends to each other; and, as they had no Secrets to hide, their Behaviour

was chearful and without Restraint. If sometimes, they were timorous, it was the Consequence of Love and Affection, and Fear of disobliging.
AT their Meals my Lord and Lady instructed them without their perceiving their main Design; for they never directly applied to any one, or gave them Directions or Advice to do this, or avoid that.—Their Counsel was always given obliquely, by praising such a Gentleman's Son, who was so extreamly good; that, though no more than Five Years old, he read exceedingly well, had all the Psalms by heart, and wanted much to learn to Write.
Then my Lord would add, I have entreated his Father to indulge the Child, and have prevail'd.'—'I told you, reply'd my Lady, that that Boy would do well, for I have always found him fond of his Book.
—Sometimes my Lord much pity'd a Gentleman, who had spent a great deal of Money on his Son's Education. 'The Boy, said he, was such a Fool he would learn nothing, but was always with the Servants; so that now, the poor Man is obliged to bind him Apprentice to a Captain of a dirty Ship.'—'I am heartily sorry, reply'd my Lady, for the good Man, and for his silly Son; but

since the Boy would not be a Gentleman, I think his Father was in the Right to oblige him to live in Dirt and Nastiness, especially since he lov'd it.'
NOT a Word of these Sort of Insinuations was lost to the Children. Their little Thoughts were set to work, and they never failed making the Application. They were very fond of Gay's Fables, and always apply'd to my Lord and Lady for the just Meaning when in Doubt, and received Answers, not only satisfactory, but pleasant and entertaining. On these and every other Occasion, they were spoken to by their Parents and Tutor in proper and elegant English, and were set right if their Answers were not in the best Terms.
A severe Reprimand was scarcely ever used, but when they were guilty of some Act, that had the least Tendency to Cruelty or Ill-nature.—The Torturing a Fly or a Sparrow—a pert Answer to a poor Person or a Servant, were Crimes, that brought a Rebuke and a Lesson that ended in Tears, and an Acknowledgment of the Fault; but if they told an Untruth, or prevaricated on any Examination, no Interest, nor all the Promises they could make, were capable to prevent a Chastisement that made the Guilty and Innocent tremble. The Maxim

of my Lord was, never to punish in a Passion, and as seldom as possible; but when really necessary, to do it effectually; and not make it a mere Ceremony.

WITH regard to their Servants, they were look'd on, almost in the Light of Children, and had a natural Right to Protection and Advice. As Servants, they were obliged to a Strictness in their Duty, but as Men, they were treated with that Humanity and Tenderness every Creature is intitled to. They obey'd their Orders with Alacrity and Chearfulness, because they were never given with Haughtiness, or in an angry Manner.
FOR a Nobleman, he had many uncommon and singular Notions. He had Prayers every Morning and Night, and all the Family assisted with great Decency. His Lordship thought, that the Duties of Religion, were of the utmost Consequence to Society, and the only Security for the Faith and Confidence of Man to Man.—He was surprized, how People could, with Justice, complain of the Theft, Drunkenness, and other Immoralities of their Servants, when they not only took no Care to persuade them of the Odiousness of such Practices, by ordering them to attend the Service of

the Church, but too frequently gave Examples of these Vices themselves.
THOUGH I have mentioned Theft amongst the Vices of Gentlemen, surely those who run in Debt to Tradesmen, and suffer them to waste their Time in vain Enquiries after ther Property, commit a Robbery of the blackest Kind, and deserve equal Punishment with those Wretches, who have openly ventur'd their Lives to maintain their Extravagancies, and sometimes to satisfy their real Wants.
THIS Sort of Conduct was unknown in the Family, where, on the Delivery of any Commodity, the Value was instantly paid. By this Means he was better serv'd, less impos'd on, and bought cheaper than most of his Neighbours. Few Things surpriz'd him more, than how a Man can live and pretend to any Degree of Comfort or Content, when indebted to Numbers, and for large Sums.—He imagined that the many Examples of the fatal Consequence of such absurd Management, ought to persuade them into an opposite Behaviour; but the Want of Thought or proper Reflection, plung'd them into Extravagance, then into Mortgages, Law-Suits, and Discredit.—If possible, they avail themselves of an infamous and scandalous Practice,

And fly from Bailiffs into Parliament.
Still the Evils accumulate, and often end in a Gaol, in the Ruin of their Families, and the Families of many of their Creditors.

MY Lord was not only punctual and exact in his Dealings, but every one under him was almost compell'd to the like Conduct, for they knew his being a Nobleman gave them no Authority to commit, nor would protect them from the Punishment due to an illegal or unjust Action.
METHOD makes seeming Difficulties quite easy, and a prudent Conduct brings that Peace and Satisfaction of Mind, which we term Happiness. His Lordship's Felicity was not merely confin'd to the Prospect of his own regular Family; for he had the Pleasure to observe, that many of his Neighbours adopted some of his Rules, and that the poorer Sort began to practice a few. —If my Lord and his whole Family were constant at Church, the Gentry round, ceased to think it ungenteel, and were as constant as they.—If my Lord made Responses of the Service, or sung Psalms with an audible Voice, and was really intent on the Duties of the Place, the rest of the Congregation were brought to believe, that their assembling was for other Purposes

than shewing their Finery, Gigling, Laughing, Bowing, and the like. The Prevalency of Example, ought to oblige us to a Rectitude of Conduct, for a bad one makes us, in some Measure, guilty of the Faults of others, as a good one adds to their Virtues, and our own Merit.

AS my Lord and Lady were blessed with great Good-nature and Understanding, so were they happy in a sincere and mutual Affection. The World was not convinc'd of this from a foolish idle Fondness, when in Company; but by their Chearfulness, good Humour and Complacency to each other, and all present.—MY Lord knew of what Human Nature is compounded, and that, to keep up this Harmony, so essential to their Happiness, a little Management was sometimes necessary. He knew, that the most precious Cordials become insipid, if too frequently used, and that Nothing contributed more to preserve the true Relish of Conjugal Felicity, than a Decency, even to Delicacy.—They rose early in the Morning, and instantly retir'd to their own Apartments, and never appear'd to each other, but, if not as fine, at least as clean, as when going to Court. They were so exact in this Point, that they had two Beds in their Chamber, and frequently slept asunder. This gave a

Relish and a Poignancy to their most refined Joys, and brought with it that Sort of Pleasure that attends on Novelty, without the Assistance of Variety.

WERE I to be minute on the whole Oeconomy of the Family, this would rather be the Memoirs of Lord TRUEGOOD, than the History of JACK CONNOR.—The many Methods he practised to avoid Drinking to Excess himself, and preventing it in others; —His sundry Contrivances to convince the Poor of the Necessity of Labour and Industry; His successful Arts to abolish profane Swearing in his Family and Neighbourhood, and the many Schemes made use of, to persuade the Natives into Justice and Honesty, would fill a Volume.—What has already been said, are merely Sketches, and the Out-lines of the Picture: The nice Finishing of the Features, with the Colouring and Drapery, I must leave to the Management of the skilful Reader, whilst I pursue the Account of my little Friend.

ANONIMOUS.



NEXT Morning Mr. Kindly found the Servants in the same merry Mood, and very chearfully agreed with them, but could by no Means guess the real Cause. He forgot not however, to send Mrs. Mathews to John Long's, to enquire after little Jack. She return'd in Raptures.—'Lord, Mr. Kindly, said she, I never saw so fine a Child in all my born Days; to be sure his Father was a healthy Man, and a good natur'd Man, for the little Fellow is as strong as Herclus, and his Complexion is as fine White and Red, as any King's Son in the Land; and he laughs and smiles, and is as happy as any Thing. God bless it!—Though I am a Virgin, as I may say, yet I thinks I should not blush, if he was

my own Son, and I am sure you need not be ashamed of him, for 'tis no Harm for a Man.'—'How, how, said Kindly, so, Mrs. Mathews, you would infer that the Child is mine'—'Eh? Lord, Sir, said she, He's so like'—She would have said more, but the Muscles of her Face took an involuntary Motion, and oblig'd her to run off in a loud Laugh.—I believe, said he, I have at last found out the Reason of so much Diversion in the Family. How apt are People to think amiss, and invent Scandal. They are happy, when they can indulge the Thought, that their Superiors do wrong; because, in some Sort, it brings them down to their own Level, and when we walk in the same Line, no wonder if our Authority is diminished.—I'm pleas'd however, they think no worse of me, for in this they will soon find their Error.—He was going on with many moral Reflections, and considering how to proceed, when the Bell summoned him to Dinner.
AT Table, my Lady's Woman was a little merry, and gave such Hints about old Men and young Girls, that my Lord's Gentleman could not forbear joyning in the Satyr. He declar'd, that if venerable Nestors practis'd such Gambols in the Parish, he,

and all the young Fellows would be obliged to run away for Shame.—No, no, Mr. Sympson, cry'd Mrs. Tittle, You ought rather to stay, when you are sure of finding an old Fellow to Father your Handy-work.' —Very true indeed, Madam, said Sympson; but you know they say, an old Cock treads sure.—At this witty Stroke Mrs. Tittle laugh'd immoderately, and fix'd her Eyes on Mr. Kindly, but the Butler look'd grave, and having empty'd his Glass, said, Why lookee, Madam, d'ye see, when I am in Company, I love to understand what the Company say; so, d'ye see, because as how, I don't know what you and that Gentleman laugh at, mayhap it is at me. If so, out with it a God's Name, for if it be true, I'll own it, but if it be a Lye, as I suspect it is, keep it to yourselves, for I can't scold with a Gilflirt, and I have something else to do, than knock down a Butterfly.
—Then clapping his Hand on Madam the Governant's Shouder, who had not spoke a Word, cry'd,— What say you, Madam, to all this? You that know the very Marrow and Quintessence of good Manners. For my Part, d'ye see, I am for letting every Tub stand on its own Bottom.—That's my Way, Mamzell.




Mon Dieu, Monsieur de Butler, said Mademoiselle le Meagre, I protes I am quite confus. Mademoiselle Tittel, she talk of de Men, and of de Girl, and laff so mouch, dat I assure you is ver mouch contre de bien Séance. Monsieur Kindly say noting, but Monsieur de Sympson he laff at one Monsieur Nestor and Monsieur Oldcock, but say noting non plus, and Monsieur Butler, he look serieux, and make a beau Discours on de Gilfleur, de Papillon and a Tub.—Bon Dieu! I understand not one Syllabe.'—'I protest, Madamoiselle, said Mr. Kindly, you are just on a Par with the Rest of the good Company; but People of Wit and fine Teeth, are apt to shew their Excellencies.—In all Probability Mrs. Tittle was going to make some very smart Answer, when a Servant entered, and told Mr. Kindly, that my Lord desired the Favour of his Company, which broke up the Party for this Time.
MR. CASSOCK, a young Clergyman, who was Tutor to the Children, constantly dined with my Lord, where Mr. Kindly was often sent for, as his Lordship particularly esteemed him; for he was most careful and diligent in his Duty, of just Principles, and strong and nervous Understanding. Mr. Kindly found only my Lord, my Lady and

the Chaplain at Table. When two or three Glasses, and some common Chat had gone round, my Lady ask'd him when he heard from his Sons?—'Very lately, Madam, said Mr. Kindly, thank God, and this good Family, the Boys are in a Way of advancing themselves; for they know that their Virtue and Industry only can recommend them to his Lordship's Favour and Protection.'—They shall not want that, reply'd my Lord, my last Letters mention your Son Jack, as the most diligent Reader in the Temple. I was so pleas'd with the Character they gave him, that I have wrote to my Friend and Relation, the Lord Chancellor, in his Favour; so that, who knows but Councellor Kindly may be imported into this Kingdom with the next Chancellor?'—The good old Man could not refrain from Tears of Joy.— 'You have not mentioned, said my Lady, how my Favourite Billy is; he was always fond of going to Church, and Reading Prayers; so, of Course he must be a Parson.'—'Yes, Madam, said Kindly, he was so inclin'd.—Thank God, he is in good Health, and minds his Duty in the College, but I fear he reads too much, for I'm informed he intends to sit for the next Fellowship, unknown to his Friends.'—

Mr. Kindly, said my Lady, you are very happy in your Sons, and I assure you, your Daughter Betty has her Share of Merit. She is a very good Girl, and minds her Work with Mrs. Le Meagre extreamly well. In a Year or two she will be able to manage a House; so, Mr. Kindly, you must open your Bags, and I shall try and get her a good Husband.'—'I humbly thank your Ladyship, said Kindly; but a Child of Sixteen, bred up so much under your Ladyship's good Instructions, I hope can't entertain Thoughts of that Sort.'—'Who, reply'd my Lord, can tell the Thoughts of Girls! We must leave them to Time; but Mr. Kindly, since your three Children are in some Measure provided for, I should be glad to know, if you have any more, that I could assist you in.'—More, my Lord, said Kindly, I protest I don't rightly comprehend your Lordship.' — 'Why, Mr. Kindly, said the Chaplain, you blush, and that is a sure Sign of your comprehending; but since your Memory is so bad, permit me to rub it up, by asking you a single Question.'—'Sir, reply'd Kindly, you may ask as many as you please; but, as I am ignorant of any particular Obligation, I shall certainly only

give you such Answers as I think proper.'—'Guilty, guilty, my Lord, cried the Parson, 'tis plain by his Evasions.— Come, come, old Gentleman, to the Point, answer fairly, Have you not been Flesh and Blood?—Did not Temptation appear in the Shape of Molly Connor, the Miller's Daughter;—And was not the Fruit of your Labour a —'a Bastard, said Kindly, Is it not so you mean, Sir?' —'Just so, indeed, Sir, reply'd the Chaplain, a fine chopping Boy.'
'SINCE, said Mr. Kindly, my Lord and Lady are present at the heavy Charge laid on me by this very young Gentleman, I think myself bound in Duty to answer. —Your Lordship knows me incapable of Falshood, therefore I aver, in the most solemn Manner, there is not the least Foundation for so malicious and scandalous a Report. I am not ignorant of the Cause. and shall fully satisfy my Lord and Lady, but not before this worthy Gentleman, to whom I hope to be permitted to ask a Question or two, in my Turn.'—'Undoubtedly, said my Lady, 'tis but fair and just.'—'Stand fast, Mr. Cassock, said my Lord, or Old Kindly will be too many for you.'—'Oh, my Lord, answered Cassock, I fear no one but an old Woman; if he

will prove himself such, I shall run for it immediately.'—Very well, Sir, said Kindly, very well; will your Reverence permit me to ask, How would you have behaved to me, if I vented on you the same Wit and Slander you were just now so good to bestow so liberally upon me?—I hope, Sir, reply'd Cassock, the Dignity of my Function makes a wide Difference between me, and People in your Sphere.'— You mean, Sir, said Kindly, that it ought to make a wide Difference; but as you seem to want that Knowledge, I shall, with my Lord's Permission, tell you wherein the Dignity consists.—When we, the poor Laity, who work for, and pay you, are Proud, Tyrannical, Envious, and the like, your Function obliges you to Meekness, Modesty, Love, and universal Charity, and Good-will to all Mankind, that we may see and admire the Charms of such a Conduct, and be almost compell'd to imitate it; 'tis then, and then only, that a real Dignity is added to your Function; but when a Parson busies himself only about his Tythes, is immoral, too low-minded, or too full of Grandeur, to help or administer Comfort to his poor Parishioners;—when he notoriously follows God for the Loaves and the Fishes;—when

he performs the Offices of the Church, with his Eyes wandering to every Object, and his Hand adjusting a new-acquir'd Tippet, or displaying a Brilliant Ring;—when he forgets the Fervour of his Duty, and seems to Read with a slighting Indifference;—when he takes no Pains to reconcile the Divisions of his Neighbours, but foments little Animosities, and adds Slander to Slander, 'tis then, tho' his Function remains, his Dignity is lower'd even below the Sexton's.—Now, Mr. Cassock, if you know any of your Brethren who act in this Manner, tho' they preach like Angels, you may assure them, the ignorant Laity will hold them, and their Dignity, in very great Contempt,—at least I promise you, John Kindly will.'
'WELL said, old Gentleman, cry'd my Lord, upon my Word a notable Discourse!—Discouse, said my Lady, I really think it a most admirable Lesson.—Why, Mr. Cassock, continued she, Mr. Kindly has furnish'd you with Texts enow for twenty Sermons.'—Ay, ay, said my Lord, but I hope Mr. Cassock's good Sense will rather incline him to apply the Moral, which will certainly add to my good Opinion of him.'

'MR. CASSOCK blush'd, but answer'd, I am not so vain as to believe myself faultless; but perhaps I may be guilty of some, that I have not properly attended to. To shew your Lordship my Willingness to amend, I am extreamly pleased at Mr. Kindly's plain Dealing, and shall endeavour to take the Hint.'—'And I am, said my Lord, as much pleas'd, you take his honest Freedom in the true Light; for, believe me, 'tis less criminal to commit a Fault, than impatiently to bear a gentle Admonition.'—'Sir, said Kindly to the Chaplain, since you are so good to forgive me, I most heartily ask your Pardon, if I have made Use of any unguarded Expressions.'—'Why, said my Lady, this Matter is settled just as it ought to be;— but about this Boy, for a Boy there certainly is.'—'Madam, said Kindly, if you will permit me, I shall mention all I know of this Affair.'—'We can spare you that Trouble, said my Lord, for my Lady and I know it already; but let us send for the young Stranger, for I long to see him.'—'I was, said my Lady, as impatient as you, and have sent for him already.'—She rung the Bell, and having enquir'd of the Servant, was told, John Long's Wife had been in the Kitchen this

half Hour.—Then, said my Lady, pray desire her, and her little Charge to come in.—All the Servants had been admiring poor Jack, and mounted with him and Mrs. Long, almost into the Parlour. Mrs. Long made her profound Honours, and my Lady spoke very tenderly to her, and of her Family.—Mr. Kindly then presented Jack Connor, saying, My Lord, this is my little Boy, who is much improv'd since Yesterday.

MRS. LONG had taken great Care to wash him well and clean, and comb his Head. His fine light-brown Hair hung in natural Curls, and his Complexion was remarkably good. He had clean Linen, and his own red Waistcoat and old Breeches; but the good Woman had not yet given him a Coat, nor Shoes nor Stockings.

MY Lord and Lady seem'd charm'd with his Countenance, tho' the poor Child was in the utmost Confusion and Astonishment.—My Lord's two Sons now came in, and my Lady call'd them to her.—'My dear Harry, said she, here is a poor little Boy that has lost his Father and Mother, and was stripp'd of all his Cloaths. I believe he is a very good Child; so, you know, 'twould be a Sin to let him go quite naked, and starve.'—'O dear, said

Harry, indeed I'll give him my brown Coat and Breeches.'—'And indeed, Madam, said Billy, I'll give him a Shirt and a Pair of Stockings.'—'And I'm sure, said Harry, my Shoes will be large enough.' —They saw my Lady's consenting Looks, and instantly ran to perform their Promise. All were pleas'd at the Tenderness and Good-nature of the Children; and whilst they were absent, Mr. Kindly ask'd Jack, where was his Book? The Boy could just say, 'here, Sir,' and gave it him.—This Book, my Lord, said Kindly, has greatly prejudiced me in Favour of this poor Child. I caught him reading in it, and I made him turn to another Part, which he distinctly read; and, by Accident, it was this Paragraph.—Mr. Kindly gave the Book to Mr. Cassock, who read it, which affected my Lord, but brought Tears into my Lady Eyes.

THERE seems to me, said my Lord, somewhat remarkable in the Story of this Child; I'll try him a little. Then turning to Mrs. Long, told her to leave the Boy with him. When Mrs. Long had retired, he took Jack between his Knees, and with great Fondness and Good-humour, ask'd him many Questions, and received short, but very proper Answers. He then shew'd

him a Guinea and a Shilling, but the Child knew not what they were. At last he produc'd an Halfpenny, and Jack readily told the Name.—'Well, my Dear, said my Lord, what will you do with that Halfpenny? —I must, reply'd Jack, give it to my Mother, for I always give it to her.'— And which Way, said my Lord, do you get an Halfpenny?'—'I run, said the Child, after every Body in the Road, and they give me an Hapeny for the Love of God.' 'That's my good Child, said my Lord;' and turning to Mr. Kindly, added, I can easily discover the Profession of his Parents, or those he was with; but his Reading and his Accent, I own, surprize me. However, since Providence has directed him to take Sanctuary in my House, I am determin'd to take Care of him.— I think, continued he, the saving an Innocent from Perdition, and breeding him up in virtuous Principles, is in Fact giving him a new Birth, and encreasing our own Happiness, in the same Degree we give it to others.'—'The Power, said my Lady, of doing Good, is certainly the highest Gratification a rational Mind is capable of receiving.'—'True, indeed Madam, said Kindly, your Power to do Good, is Great, but Heaven has added another

Blessing to you both, in giving you Hearts and Minds ready and willing to exercise that Power on every proper Object.—In the Name of this poor tender Creature, I humbly thank your Lordship, and my good Lady; and I pray God he may live to shew his Gratitude to such bountiful Benefactors.'

THE two Boys, by this Time, had got the Cloaths, and running with them into the Parlour, were going immediately to strip poor Jack, but my Lord stopp'd them, and kissing Harry, told him, 'He was so good and charitable, he would give him the prettiest little Horse he could get, and a Bridle and Saddle.'—'And because, said my Lady, my dear Billy follow'd his Brother's good Example, I shall do as much for him.'—The Children were quite happy, and Harry ran, as my Lord bid him, for Mrs. Long.—Here, Mrs. Long, said my Lord, take back your little Fellow for this Night. Dress him in these Cloaths, and be so good to come with him To-morrow, for we all intend to take some Care of Jack.
—His Lordship then put the Boy and Half a Guinea into her Hand, and she bless'd their Honours, and retir'd.—Before Mrs. Long quitted the House, Mr. Kindly desir'd her to pack

up all the old Rags belonging to Jack, and bring them to him.


CHAP. IX.


What can our Judgment or our Prudence do
If Chains of Accidents concur not too?
One happy Accident, One lucky Hit,

Out-ballances our Wisdom and our Wit.

ANONIMOUS.


MRS. LONG found the Coat and other Things, fitted Jack very well, and had dress'd him with great Neatness. On his Arrival at my Lord's, the whole Family admir'd his Strength and his exact Make, but he seem'd more aukward than before, and was very uneasy with his Shoes. Mr. Kindly provided him with some Necessaries, and employ'd him in attending my Lord's Sons in their Amusements, and in cleaning their Shoes, and brushing their Coats. At leisure Times he heard him read in the Bible, or his own Book, and my Lord and Lady often did the same.
IN six Months the Boy was quite chang'd. The chearful and happy Disposition indulg'd him by Nature, shew'd itself on a

thousand Occasions; insomuch, that he became a general Favourite, and was sensible of his Happiness. Mr. Kindly, from Time to Time gave him such Lessons of Duty and Gratitude, as suited his Age, and Mr. Cassock taught him his Prayers, Catechism, and other Matters, equal with my Lord's Children.
ONE Day, as Mr. Kindly was writing in his Office, Jack approach'd him, and blushing, but with a modest Smile, look'd up, and seem'd as if he had a Favour to ask. —'Well Jack, said the good Man, d'ye want another Book.'—'No indeed, Sir, reply'd the Child, I don't want a Book.' —'Why, you Rogue, said Kindly, I hope you are not tir'd of Reading?' 'Yes indeed, Sir, said Jack.' 'O ho, said the old Man, very well, since you will not read, and be a good Boy, I shall get you a Leather Coat and Cap, and you shall be a Postillion, and lie with the Horses.' Jack's Countenance chang'd, his Eyes swell'd, and he burst into a violent Fit of Crying.—Mr. Kindly was a long Time before he could dry his Tears, or get him to speak and explain what he wanted.—Sir, said Jack at last, indeed and indeed, I am not tir'd of Reading, for if you please, I would be very good, and write as you

do, if you'd give me Pens and Paper. —The Tenderness of the old Gentleman was touch'd at the Child's Request.—Yes, said he, my dear Jack, you shall have Pens and Paper, and I will get you a little Desk in the Office, and teach you to write myself.—Jack was quite delighted, and the Novelty of the Employment diverted and pleased Mr. Kindly, particularly as his Pupil was so apt a Scholar, that in eighteen Months he wrote a very good Hand, and perfectly understood the four first Rules of Arithmetick.
HE was now about Ten Years of Age, and seem'd to have a Faculty in learning whatever he undertook. In the Plays of Children he was dexterous, and in the little Occupations of the Family, he was Handdy and Neat. He had a certain Manner of doing Things, that Nature alone can give, and what some can only imitate, even by Labour and Pains. Another natural Gift began at this Time to be remarkable, for he had a fine Voice, and greatly diverted the Maids with Irish Songs. Some were of Humour, and requir'd a proper Management of Voice and Words to keep up the Drollery. This he was a perfect Master of.

The Boys were one Morning at Play in the Fields, and Mr. Cassock, who commonly attended them, was, by Accident, at a good Distance. Master Harry and Jack had some Words, and Harry gave him a Blow on the Face. Jack greatly resented this, and told him, if he was not my Lord's Son, he'd beat him heartily. Harry, fir'd at the Rebuke and Menace, pull'd off his Coat, and flew at him like a little Tiger. Jack defended himself without returning a Stroke, though his Hair was almost torn off his Head. At last he receiv'd a violent Cut which stunn'd him, and made his Nose bleed. He then cried out most bitterly, and run directly Home. The Tutor heard his Cries, and saw him running, and joining the Boys, Master Billy told him the real Truth. As Jack was entering the House, my Lord saw him from a Window in his Study, and order'd a Servant to bring him up. With some Difficulty he got the Story out of him, and Mr. Cassock and the two Boys entering with my Lady, my Lord was confirm'd in the Truth of what he said, and looking very serious, and in great Concern, sat down and took up his Book.
'I AM, said my Lady, quite surpriz'd and astonish'd, that Harry could behave

in so brutal a Manner to a poor Boy that loves him.— Come hither Jack, said she, —Do you think you could beat Harry, if you were to box and fight fairly?' 'Yes indeed, please your Ladyship, said Jack, for Master Harry knows I'm stronger than him.'—'Very well, reply'd my Lady, I believe what you say, and now remember, you have my Lord's Leave and mine, to beat him soundly whenever he strikes you again.'—Then turning to a Servant, order'd Jack to be taken down and clean'd.— Poor Harry was in great Tribulation; but when my Lady, very gravely, directed him to go to the Kitchen, and dine with the Servants, he cry'd most dreadfully. —Why, Sir, said my Lady, you are fit for no other Company; for, when a young Gentlemen will fight with his Servant, does he not make him his equal? But I suppose you think you may do what you please with Jack; but to convince you, Sir, you are no better than him, except you behave better, you shall wear his Cloaths, and he yours, and then I believe every Stranger will take him for Master Harry, and you for Jack Connor.


HARRY begg'd and intreated, and gave many Promises of never doing the like again.—You see, said my Lady, when one

does a naughty Thing, no-body speaks in our Favour. I cannot forgive you, except my Lord does.—Then turning about, 'Will your Lordship, said she, pardon Harry this one Fault, he promises, and is penitent.'—'My Dear, said my Lord, what can I do in the Affair? If Master Harry was a Gentleman, and had beaten a Servant of mine, I should certainly resent the Affront, except he begg'd, and obtain'd my Servant's Pardon.'— That's true indeed, said my Lady, so, my dear Billy, call up Jack, and I am sure Harry will beg his Pardon very sincerely.' —Mr. Cassock, who knew his Time, began now to intercede for Master Harry, and assur'd my Lord he never knew him do a Thing of that Sort, or put himself into so violent a Passion before; that, as it was the first Fault, he begg'd my Lord to forgive him, and could almost promise it would be the last.
MY Lord shak'd his Head, and the two Boys entering, my Lady spoke to Harry, who immediately went and kiss'd Jack, and very heartily ask'd his Pardon. Jack blush'd, but with a Smile bow'd, and kiss'd him again.—Harry then went to my Lord, and on his Knees begg'd his Forgiveness. My Lord rais'd him, saying, I forgive

you, my Dear, this Fault, since you are sorry for committing it, but depend on your Honour, that you will keep your Word, and never vex your Papa again. Now go and beg my Lady's Pardon, for you have greatly offended and fretted her. —My Lady took him in her Arms, and the Affair ended much to the Satisfaction of all Parties.
TWO Days after, the three Boys, the Chaplain, and a Servant with a Gun, went in the Morning to walk as usual. A small Rivulet run by one of the Fields, which they generally cross'd by the Help of large Stones, but an Abundance of Rain having fallen, it was rais'd above four Feet, and very rapid. This stopp'd their Progress; but, as they mounted the Brook to find another Passage, Harry saw a Jack-daw in a Tree on the opposite Side, and the Boys begg'd the Servant to fire at it, and they mounted the Ditch to see it fall. Jack went a little lower to get a convenient Stand, but scarcely had he been there a Moment, when, the Earth breaking under Harry's Feet, he fell into the River.—His Brother shriek'd, but Jack instantly took Hold of a Bough of a Tree that fell near the Water, and stretching out as far as he was able, caught Harry by the Hair, just as he rose, having

been carryed by the Stream about ten Yards, and held him fast.—Billy roar'd and stamp'd, and the poor Parson and Servant were frighten'd almost into Stupidity, till Jack call'd out here—here.—They got to him just in Time, for his whole Weight resting on his left Arm, his little Force was almost exhausted.—Cassock and the Servant jump'd in directly, and rescu'd Harry; but, not immediately attending to the Care of Jack, the poor Boy could not retire, but fell in between them. However, they divided their Labour, and brought the Children safely out.
JACK had only got a Ducking, but Harry was some Time before he could speak, but being laid on the Grass, he soon recovered. The Tenderness of the Boys is not to be express'd; they kiss'd him a thousand Times, and even cry'd with Joy. Mr. Cassock, fearing they might catch Cold, walk'd pretty smartly towards the House, near which they met my Lord, looking over some Improvements. He was greatly surpriz'd at the Condition they were all in, but much more so, when the Chaplain told him of the Accident, and particularly of Jack's ready Thought. My Lord was much mov'd, and most affectionately embracing the Children, carry'd them to my Lady,

who waited their coming in to Breakfast. —As my Lord told her the Story, Love, Tenderness, Surprise and Fear, were visible in her Countenance. Her Heart seemed ready to leap from its Habitation, and the whole Mother rushing violently on her Spirits, she seiz'd Harry in her Arms, and would have fall'n with him, had not my Lord and Mr. Cassock supported her to her Chair, where she did not recover till her Tears were suffer'd to come to her Assistance.
THE Boys were put in warm Beds, and the Chaplain was advis'd to change his Cloaths. My Lord and the Women stayed with my Lady, and indeed she had great Occasion for them.—Mr. Kindly had been absent on Business; but when he return'd, and heard of the Affair, he trembled excessively; but Joy succeeding, he ran to my Lord, and Lady, then to the two Boys, whom he almost smother'd with Caresses, then to the Chaplain, and then to my Lord again. In a Word, the poor Man could think and speak of Nothing else, and even of that not very distinctly.
THE Hurry of the Family ceas'd by Degrees, and all Matters were set right by Dinner Time, and Jack took his Place behind the Boys, whom he always waited on.

A Neighbouring Gentleman hearing of the Accident, came to felicitate my Lord on Master Harry's providential Escape.—At Dinner it was the particular Conversation, and Mr. Cassock was compell'd to repeat the Morning Adventure with all its Circumstances, which often oblig'd Jack to blush and hold down his Head.—My Lord bid him never to be ashamed at doing Good, and the Gentleman was very lavish of his Praises.—My Lady look'd at Master Harry, and hinting at the Quarrel, said,—We may plainly see how much it is our Interest to be Good and Friendly to, and avoid giving Offence to the poorest Creature, since every Man, however low or mean, may, if he pleases, be of great Use, or do an irreparable Injury to the Greatest. Let what will be our Situations, we are born to help and assist each other, according to our Power and Abilities, and he, who does it not, destroys the End of his Creation.—This, said she, is a plain Truth, and I hope you and your Brother will remember and practise it, as long as you live.

THUS, out of every Accident, or the most common Occurences, did these wise Parents inculcate Virtue and Humanity in the Minds of their Children, and gave them

a moral Certainty of their being hereafter happy in themselves, and of making others happy.

IN the Evening the Gentleman took his Leave, and calling Jack, kiss'd him and put a Crown in his Hand, which he immediately deposited with Mr. Kindly. My Lord gave the Servant which had been with the Children, a Farm worth Ten Pounds a Year. Many poor neighbouring Families felt, on this Occasion, his Goodness and Liberality, and he added ten Children more to the Charity Scheme before-mentioned. The Chaplain was not forgot in my Lord's Thoughts, and my Lady order'd Jack new Cloaths from Head to Foot.
AS the Family was extremely belov'd, no Wonder if all the Gentlemen round continued for some Time to visit and congratulate them on their good Fortune. Scarcely one quitted Bounty-Hall, without a Mark of Regard for Jack. These he always consign'd to Mr. Kindly, so that his Riches at last amounted to the mighty Sum of Ten Pounds.




CHAP. X.


The Reason why so few Marriages are happy, is, Because young Ladies spend their Time in making Nets, and not in making Cages.


SWIFT'S MAXIMS.



PERHAPS my merry Readers are extremely angry at being so long detain'd in Company with Boys, whilst others of a more serious Turn are pleas'd with the Opening of the Heart, and the gradual Increase of Knowledge in the Minds of Children. Others again, reading only as a mere Amusement, and to kill Time, are in an actual State of Indifference, and provided the great End is answer'd, are equally charm'd with Clarissa, as Tom Jones. That these Classes may be gratified, I shall beg Leave to introduce a young Lady, by way of Episode; and because she is the Daughter of my good Friend Mr. Kindly.

MISS BETTY KINDLY, now turn'd of Twenty, was a most agreeable Girl, with good Sense and good Humour. Mr. Cassock had a small paternal Fortune, a good Allowance from my Lord, and forty Pounds

a Year, for officiating for the Minister of the Parish, who was about Fourscore Years of Age. This young Gentleman was not insensible of the Charms of Miss Betty, and of her more essential Qualifications; and knowing my Lord's Sons would soon be removed from his Care, determin'd to take the Advantage of the general Joy, and sollicit my Lady's Interest. He suffer'd not the Time to elapse, but took the first Opportunity when my Lady was alone.—She rally'd him a little at first, on his being in Love, but assuring him of all her good Offices, added, —I believe a little of my Interest will go a great Way, for I much doubt if you have not a powerful Friend already in the Garrison.
—Mr. Cassock blush'd, and, aukwardly thanking her Ladyship, retir'd.—It seems Mademoiselle Le Meagre had inform'd her of what pass'd in Miss Betty's Heart, which she was convinced of, by some Observations on her late Conduct.
MY Lord was extremely pleased at this Discovery, and declar'd it was what he had always wish'd. After Dinner he sent for Mr. Kindly, and the Chat at last fell on Jack Connor.—I wish, my Lord, said Mr. Kindly, you would permit my instructing that poor Boy in the Duty of my Station. He

is surprisingly diligent, notable, and honest; and so expert at his Pen, that, young as he is, he has often assisted me.—I think I have been a faithful Servant to your Lordship, and your truly noble Father, who bred me from a Child; and it would give me the greatest Joy to have almost a Certainty of leaving as just a one to succeed me.—Age, my Lord, steals on, and should Heaven indulge me with a few more Years of Strength and Abilities, I must then submit to our common Destiny.—My Lord wink'd at her Ladyship, and she at Mr. Cassock, who instantly withdrew, and my Lady soon follow'd.
'JACK, said my Lord, has sav'd my Son; if I had no other Motive than that, you may be assur'd he is greatly in my Thoughts; but I love the Boy for many Reasons, having notic'd particularly his Behaviour; but as I am determin'd to send him with my Sons to Mr. Johnston's, where he may learn a little more, we must postpone your Scheme till his Return.— Since you think, continued my Lord, so much of my Jack, give me Leave to think a little of your Betty.—The Girl is of Age, and you know young Wenches are Flesh and Blood.—In two Words, poor Cassock loves her; and, if my Intelligence

be right, Betty is far from disliking him; therefore, if you approve of the Match, the Parson must have some Money to buy a new Gown, and a fresh Cargoe of Sermons.'—'Does your Lordship approve of it, said Kindly? 'I do, said my Lord.'—'Then, reply'd the old Man, I have no Will, but your Lordship's, and To-morrow, Sir, I shall put into your Hands the Value of three hundred Pounds, and submit my dear Child to your Lordship's Judgment, thinking myself the happiest of Men, by the Favour and Indulgence of the best of Masters.'


I thank you, said my Lord, for your Compliment, and to shew you how much I approve of this Union, and that your Daughter may be under your own Eye, I intend to present Mr. Cassock to this Parish, on the Death of the present Incumbent. You know 'tis worth two hundred Pounds a Year, and that Dr. Canter is superannuated, and cannot last long.— Kindly, with uplifted Hands, was attempting to utter his Gratitude, but my Lord stopp'd him, saying,—No more of that, Mr. Kindly, I am now going to advance this Matter, And retiring, left the happy old Man but the Power of thanking Providence,

and admiring the Goodness of my Lord.

IN a few Days Mr. Cassock was presented in Form to Miss Kindly. All the Conversation of the Family was on the approaching Wedding, which was fix'd at no longer a Distance than a Week, and some neighbouring Families were invited.
WERE I a French Memoir Writer, I should naturally embrace this Opportunity to extol the Virgin Charms of the Bride, and describe the Beauty and Propriety of every Part of her Dress without a slavish Regard to Truth. I should then have said,— Scarcely were the Curtains drawn which permitted the Sun's Appearance, when Miss opened those Eyes, that alone could eclipse his Brightness. She sigh'd, and sometimes wish'd, and sometimes trembled at the Approach of the Time, when she was to be,—she knew not what,—she knew not where. Hope and Fear ingross'd her whole Imagination till the Hour arriv'd, when she bid an eternal Adieu to that Bed, destin'd never more to embrace her Virgin Innocence. Mademoiselle Le Meagre and Mrs. Tittle assisted in adjusting her Dress, and her Ladyship deigned to give her Advice and Help. Her Tresses were of the finest

Brown, which hanging behind in small natural Ringlets, were nicely order'd to crown her Forehead, and touch her Ears which were ornamented with Brilliants; and, though of the first Water, her Charms added a particular Lustre and Refulgency to. Diamonds likewise sparkled round her lovely Neck, and, a little above the heavenly Orbs, hung the glittering Cross,
Which JEWS might kiss and Infidels adore.
Her Stays discover'd a Shape the most exact and delicate, and the Robe that clos'd on it, was of the finest white Silk of Padua. A Bunch of Jasmin, Hyacinths and Roses, took their Place near her Neck, and seem'd to envy the Vicinity of a superior Fragrancy. She descended to the Apartment where the Company, and her desiring Lover, impatiently attended, and where a most magnificent and elegant Dinner was provided. The first Course consisted of—I hope the courteous Reader will excuse my not proceeding farther in mere Sound, and permit me to say in plain English, that the Wedding-Day at last came, and that Miss Betty behav'd as Girls naturally do on the

Occasion. My Lady had made her a Present of genteel plain Cloaths; and her good Complexion Shape and Size, made her a very desirable Object. Mr. Cassock look'd, and seem'd to think her a Subject worth handling.—When the Ceremony, and the usual Compliments were over, my Lord declar'd his Intention of giving the Parish to Mr. Cassock, on the Death of Doctor Canter.—This was a Comment on the Text, that Mr. Cassock had not known before; and, as it perfectly agreed with his Way of Thinking, he look'd on the Author as a very learned and wise Man.—The Truth is, he was so struck with my Lord's Bounty, that neither he nor his Bride could return their Thank but by their humble Obeisances.
MY Lord had still in Reserve what was to complete the Reward of Mr. Kindly's Fidelity.—He first bestow'd many Compliments on him before all the Company, and then added, —When my Boys are settled at Mr. Johnston's School, my Lady and I purpose staying for some Time in England. You will then, Mr. Kindly, be so good to audit the Accounts of my Receivers, and take the Charge and Management of my Charity Children. You and the young Couple must keep this

House warm in my Absence; and, that the Roof may be always in good Order, and to defray the Expences attending your Increase of Business, I desire you will charge me with one hundred Pounds a Year extraordinary; and now, Mr. Kindly, give me Leave to regard you as my Companion and my Friend.


A PROFOUND Silence ensu'd, till the old Man, finding his Tongue, he pour'd out whatever his grateful Heart suggested, and ending in most fervent Prayers, retir'd in Haste, to give his Tears of Joy full Scope. —At Dinner he was pretty chearful; and Mirth, Good-humour and Happiness admir'd Bounty-Hall, and resided there.
As I am call'd another Way, it cannot be expected I should wait on this Company the whole Evening, much less pretend to conduct Mr. Cassock and his Bride to that Theatre, where we are suffer'd to see the Actors, but by the Reflection of Fancy.— Let it suffice to say, that the young Lady was next Morning Mrs. Cassock.

So much has been said of this noble Family, that I fear some will be apt to suspect my Veracity.—Envy will positively assert, that the Characters are absurd, unnatural, and without a Precedent.—Ill-naure will discover the Sarcasm, in placing in full

View, what the Nobility ought truly to be, in Opposition to what some really are.— The Thought of such scandalous Insinuations, determines me to quit Bounty-Hall, and shift the Scene.
'Tis necessary to inform my Readers, that Mr. Johnston, who I am now going to visit, is the Clergyman that was a Companion to my Lord in his Travels.—During their Stay at Paris, Mr. Johnston became acquainted with Madam Bonfoy, the Widow of a Captain who had been kill'd in the Service. She had sollicited for a Pension; but, being known to be a Hugonot, could never obtain it. As she had two thousand Livres a Year on the Town-House of Paris, and the Interest of some Money, she kept genteel Apartments, and liv'd in a very decent Manner with her Niece, who was about four Years old.
THE Temper of Madam Bonfoy was so like Mr. Johnston's, an Inclination for each other ensu'd, which ended, or rather increased, in Matrimony.—My Lord got him a good Living in the North of Ireland, but afterwards advis'd him to exchange for one of less Value near Portarlington, in the King's County, inhabited mostly by French Protestants, and where little of any other Language was spoken. My Lord gave

him the Plan of a School, which, by Mr. and Mrs. Johnston's good Management, could not fail of being extremely advantageous to them. Mr. Johnston had now been in that Situation near four Years, and met with great Approbation, as he had Talents peculiar to that Profession.
MASTER Harry was now twelve Years of Age, and all Things were preparing for the Journey of the three Boys. Every one in the Family began to dread the Loss of such Children, who, by a thousand little Pranks, were extremely dear to them. Miss Harriot began to pine and cry, that she was to lose her Brothers, and her Favourite little Jack. In short, it is impossible to express the silent Grief that reign'd in the House.
MR. KINDLY took up whole Days in preaching to Jack, and giving him good Advice.—Perhaps, my dear Child, said he, I may never see you again; if so, mind my Words, and I shall be always present with you, and shield you from those Evils the World is full of. If you despise and neglect them, depend upon it, Calamity and Misfortunes will attend you. That my Counsel may not be forgotten, I have wrote it down, and put it in your Trunk, that you may read, and get it by

Heart. They are the same Instructions I gave to my own Sons when they went from me, and, in general, will answer your Purposes. I have likewise, continued he, put up a good Store of Paper and Pens, and I insist on your Writing frequently to me, with a particular Account how the young Gentlemen behave, and how you employ your Time.—Jack cry'd most heartily, and faithfully promis'd to obey all his Commands, and be a good Boy.—The Children took Leave of the Neighbours, but Jack, in a very tender and particular Manner, took his of Mrs. Long and the good-natur'd Groom.

THE Coach and Servants were prepared, and the young Travellers were to set out next Morning with my Lord and Mr. Cassock. Her Ladyship being with Child, prevented her being of the Party.
THE Morning came, and the Horses were ordered to be put too.—Mr. Kindly took Jack in his Hand to the Office, and, shewing him his little Effects in a small Trunk he had provided, put therein a Purse, saying,—
Jack, here is all your Money, with some Interest, amounting to Fifteen Guineas. I know you will take great Care and keep it, till you really want it. You are no Fool, my Dear, and

he must be the greatest Fool that spends his Money idly.—Jack gave him his Word, he should find it all when he came back.—Yesterday, said Mr. Kindly, I told you I might never see you more. I have, this small Box to give you as my last Legacy. It contains a Book, that in Time you may read; but as I know you love Truth, I must have your Promise never to open it, but at the Time I direct.—Jack fell on his Knees, and assur'd him, he would never open it, if he order'd.—Then, said the old Man, mind what I say: I lay my Commands on you, never to open this Box, except you be reduced to the greatest Necessity, and almost want Bread.—So saying, he lock'd it in the Trunk, and gave Jack the Key. —Now said Mr. Kindly, I have but one Word more to say:—If God should prosper you in the World, and your Heart should swell with Pride and Arrogance, remember that Drawer, and correct those Vices.
—Pray, Sir. said Jack, what is in that Drawer?—'You shall see,' said Kindly, and, producing his old red Waistcoat, tatter'd Shirt and Breeches, said,—This, Jack, is your Original, so judge if Pride and Haughtiness will agree with such a Dress.—The Boy blush'd, and embracing

Mr. Kindly's Waist, assur'd him, he would always remember the Drawer and the Dog-Kennel.

THEY now join'd the Children, whom they found in Tears, having just quitted her Ladyship. Jack was sent in by my Lord, and on his Knees, most humbly thank'd her Ladyship for all her Goodness to him.—The parting with her Sons made her scarcely able to speak, but she bid him mind his Business, and serve God. —She could utter no more, but with a tender Embrace let him depart.
THE Servants had their Turn, and the Boys were almost hugg'd to Death.—With great Difficulty they quitted this moving Scene, and the Coach driving off, were followed by the Prayers and Blessings of a thousand of the poor Inhabitants.



CHAP. XI.


Seek you to train your fav'rite Boy?
Each Caution, ev'ry Care employ;
And e'er you venture to confide,
Let his Preceptor's Heart be try'd;
Weigh well his Manners, Life and Scope,
On these depends thy future Hope.

GAY.



THE Occurrences on the Road are not worth mentioning; but my Lord and Mr. Cassock gave the Lads a good Impression of their new Master, and explain'd the Rules and Customs of the School. Mr. Johnston was prepar'd for their Reception, and thank'd my Lord for the Honour he did him. After Supper, my Lord and Mr. Cassock went to private Lodgings. The two Brothers had a Chamber to themselves, and Jack had a small one near the Back-Stairs at the End of the Gallery.
BEFORE Eight next Morning, my Lord and Mr. Cassock went to Mr. Johnston's. All the Scholars had not yet made their Appearance; but the Bell ringing, the rest soon were in the School, where Mr. Johnston and the Family attended my Lord,

when all were seated, one of the Lads mounted a Desk, and with great Reverence began the Morning Service of the Church; another read the Lessons of the Day; Mr. Lilly, the Usher, rais'd the Psalm, and the first Boy finish'd the Prayers, except the Blessing, which Mr. Johnston always pronounced.—This over, an Hour was employ'd in examining their Exercises, and giving others for the following Day, and then they retir'd to Breakfast.
MY Lord was again conducted to School, when one of the most ingenious of the Gentlemen ascended the Pulpit, and made a Latin Oration on the Rise of Nobility. He very artfully insinuated, how happy some Families were, in always leaving Heirs to their Virtues as well as their Titles; and, that he could point out, even in these degenerate Days, a living Example of that Blessing, were he at Liberty to speak, without being suspected of Flattery; and concluded, that tho' many Patricians were a Scandal to their own and every other Order, yet some were always found who added a Lustre to the Dignity, as their Lives were an Ornament to human Nature, and their Actions the Glory of their Fellow-Citizens.

WHEN this Gentleman had finish'd, another mounted, and made a short Speech in

English, on the Happiness of a good Education, which he compar'd to a tender Plant, under the Management of a skilful Gardiner, who not only made it bear exquisite Fruit, but gave the Branches such an elegant Turn, as added a Beauty to the Place, and a Delight to the Eye.
HIS Lordship was extremely pleas'd with this Entertainment, but particularly with the distinct, emphatical and graceful Manner in which they pronounced their Words. He was not wanting in returning his Thanks to the young Gentlemen, and, giving the Usher Ten Guineas, begg'd he would be so good to buy a Dozen Bows and Arrows, and erect two Butts in the next Field, which would not only agreeably entertain them, but be a most healthful Exercise.
HIS Lordship then gave some private Directions to Mr. Johnston, and recommending the Boys to the Care of his Wife, took a most tender Leave, and return'd to Bounty-Hall.

I MUST continue at Portarlington-School above three Years. If my Reader pleases, I shall indulge his residing with me, and making all the Remarks and Applications his Understanding may suggest. Imagination must furnish him with the many Pranks and Tricks School-Boys are wont to

play, as I am not at Leisure, at present, to entertain him in that Manner. I shall confine myself to the narrow Compass of hinting at the Conduct of this School, as there is somewhat peculiar in it, and what I could wish every other had a Part of, if not the Whole.

MR. JOHNSTON was a Gentleman of very extensive Knowledge, great Application and Temper, chearful and easy in Conversation, and, above all, knew Mankind and the World perfectly well. As he had Talents peculiar for Instruction, and delighted in it, so his Virtue and Understanding convinc'd him, that rearing up good and useful Members of Society, was the most honourable Employment of Man.
HIS House could hold but twenty-five Youths, and each paid thirty Pounds a Year. When his Conduct was known, it is not to be imagined what Interest was made by Gentlemen, to have their Sons admitted, on a Vacancy.
HIS first Care was the inculcating into his Pupils, the Principles of true Religion, as the surest Foundation on which to build the moral Virtues. His next, was the inspiring into them, a certain Proportion of Ambition and temporal Happiness, and demonstrating, that Learning, Honour, and

Integrity were the most probable, if not the only Way, to attain them. For these Purposes, they constantly attended Divine Service at Church and at Home: He made them read the Prayers alternately, and, as Occasions requir'd, gave historical Accounts to explain or illustrate some Passages in the Old or New Testament.—He always treated them, not as Children, but as Gentlemen, which made them endeavour to act as such. If some were negligent of their Duty, he seem'd concern'd at it, and pity'd the unhappy Youth, that forgot himself so much as to undo, by a voluntary Neglect, all that his Ancestors had acquir'd by Knowledge and Industry.

HE took great Pains to give them an early Habit of Civility and Good Manners; and, by his own Practice, convinc'd them how agreeable such a Conduct was to every Man. He always spoke with a Bow, and Marks of Respect, and encouraged them to act in the like Manner to each other. He shew'd them, by sundry serious and comic Examples, the Use and Beauty of Politeness, and the Absurdity and bad Consequences of a clownish and brutish Behaviour.
THE Mornings were given to School Learning, in which, by his Skilfulness and

Assiduity, they made great Progress. As to fix'd Holidays, they were Strangers; but when all the Lads were perfect in their different Lessons, Mr. Johnston always return'd them Thanks, and then added,— This is very clever.—I find, Gentlemen, you have taken more than ordinary Pains; but I am so far from desiring too much Study, that, please God, if To morrow be a fine Day, we will take the Diversion of Hunting or Fishing,—just, Gentlemen, as you please.— Thus they could always command a Day of Amusement; but that Lad pass'd his Time very disagreeably, who, by his Idleness, had stopp'd the Pleasure of the rest.
THE Evenings, in some Degree, were their own, either to study in their Chambers, or divert themselves in the large Yard or Field. If the Weather did not permit the latter, Mr. Johnston us'd to say,— Well, Gentlemen, how shall we pass our Time? I have a great Notion Mr. Moore can pronounce one of Cicero's Orations as well as Mr. Stevenson.
—Sometimes he pitch'd on one of Atterbury's or Tillotson's Sermons; sometimes on Speeches in Tacitus or Livy; sometimes on Parliamentary Debates, and sometimes on Milton, or on occasional Pieces of Poetry, of Beauty and

Elegance.—The Reader always mounted the Pulpit; but if he err'd from the right Pronounciation and true Meaning of the Author, or lessen'd the Sense by false Action or too languid a Delivery, Mr. Johnston begg'd his Pardon, and desir'd to be permitted to shew, wherein he thought it might be utter'd more to the Satisfaction of the Audience.—He then took his Place, and display'd the Orator.—His determin'd and resolute Voice, stirr'd their young Blood; but when he softened into Pity at some Distress, it caught the Lads, and their Countenances shew'd it.
HE thought it absolutely necessary that a young Man should be acquainted with the History of his own Country, at least as soon as that of Egypt, Greece, or Rome. This was a fix'd Entertainment twice a Week; and his Comments, Observations and Reflections on the different Parts, were adapted to those he made them to, and had always somewhat that shew'd the Value of Liberty, and the Danger in not putting proper Bounds to it.—The Effects of Tyranny and Oppression;—the Nature of Laws and Government;—the Obligation of a King to his Subjects, and his Subjects to him;—the Happiness of a good Monarch, with the Infamy and Punishment due to

those, who wantonly attempt to disturb the Peace of the Crown, and the Peace of the People.

OF a chearful Evening Mr. Johnston has propos'd the Repetition of a good Comedy; but, as he did not conceive that acting a Play was of Use to Youth, he placed them in their Seats, and assign'd them their different Parts, which they read from different Copies. The Comedies he generally chose were Steele's, Farquhar's, and some of Cibber's, as they not only had Wit and Humour, but a certain Moral in them, not to be found in Congreve, Wycherly, Dryden, or Vanbrugh, but by wading through Obscenity.—If the Gentlemen chose a Tragedy, he made them carefully observe the Difference between a passionate Utterance, and Ranting, and between the soft and tender Manner of Expression, and the Whining, and gave them Examples himself.
BUT the most favourite Manner he had of entertaining them, because he had a Scheme in it, was giving short and pleasing Accounts of the Lives of great Men of all Nations.—The Conqueror and Captive.— The Tyrant, and the Father of his People. —The Law giver and the Incendiary.— The Patriot, and the Pretenders to Patriotism.—The Orator and the Declaimer.—The Divine.—The Lawyer.—The moral and experimental

Philosopher.—The Botanist.— Physician, and the Merchant.—The many Professions that spring from these Fountains, were at different Times set in proper and clear Lights.—Their Virtues and Uses to Society, or the Abuses of Power and Knowledge were touch'd, so as not to descend too deeply into the Sciences; but to fix the Attention of the Lads, and give him an Opportunity of discovering the Bent of their Inclinations and Geniuses.
SUCH a Conduct, he thought as necessary a Part of the Duty of a Master, as teaching them Latin or Greek, and he never fail'd communicating his Discoveries to their Parents.
HAPPY had it been for many Gentlemen, if their Genius had been properly attended to in their Youth!—The many Absurdities in the World would be avoided, and each have the Rank the Law of Nature had assign'd them.—The Martial Spirit would not be compell'd to expose himself in a Pulpit.—The tender and meek Mind would not be drove to the Field of Bustle and Slaughter.—The Physician would not prescribe at the Bar, nor the Lawyer administer Physick by Act of Parliament. — Each would be in their just Point of View,

and each have a fair Opportunity of excelling.
AS Nature gives not equal Talents to all, this good Master made proper Allowances: He was never displeas'd at one Gentleman's being less apt to learn than another, provided he found him equally diligent: On the contrary, he encourag'd and indulg'd him, and frequently stole into his Room at Night, and gave him half an Hour's private Instruction for the Business of next Day, but insisted on its being kept secret from the rest.
SELDOM was their Book an Occasion of Chastisement, but they never were excused for any vicious Act. When he found a Lad of an obstinate sullen Temper, who despis'd Learning, good Advice, or Correction, he sent him home to his Friends. —On such Occasions he always made a pathetic Speech to the School, and placed the unhappy Boy separate from the rest.— When he was to depart, Mr. Johnston walk'd with him to the Gate, and all the Gentlemen follow'd with profound Silence. Here he embrac'd him and took his Leave, praying God that this gentle Admonition might make him reflect in Time, and change his Conduct, so as to be an Honour, and not a Discredit to Society.—Then,

in a ceremonious Manner, all the rest took a melancholy Farewel.
AMONGST the many Advantages of this Seminary, Mrs. Johnston, and her Niece Nannett contributed in improving the Boys in French; and, as all the Inhabitants commonly spoke it, they acquired that Language with great Facility.—Some Evenings, when Mr. Johnston could not attend, his Wife has extremely diverted and amused them by Molier's Comedies, Gil-Blas, Scaron, and other Books of that Tendency.
THUS did this good Family look on themselves as Parents to the Children, and the Children regarded them as such.—Instruction and profitable Entertainment were so agreeably and nicely blended, that the one was never suffered to become tedious and irksome, nor the other to cloy or fill the Mind too much.



CHAP. XII.


Persuasive Folly has strong Charms,
T'allure the Feeble to her Arms.

Weakness and Vice go Hand in Hand,
And seem united by one Band.
Let Reason but assume her Seat,

Folly and Vice will soon retreat.

ANONIMOUS.



AS Jack Connor was not intended for a perfect Scholar, Mr. Johnston's Care on that Account was not so exact as to other Lads; but what regarded the moral and social Duties, he received in common with them. In the three Years at this School, he had acquir'd a good Share of Latin and some Greek, but his chief Pleasure was in Reading, and making Extracts of useful and entertaining Passages from History, Voyages, Poetry, and the like, of which Mr. Johnston had a good Collection always open to the Gentlemen. This improved him in Writing, made strong Impressions on his Mind, and gave him a Falicity, and a genteel and easy Turn of Language, that much better Scholars are Strangers

to. He spoke French with great Fluency, for Mademoiselle Nannett took some Pains to perfect him in it, and as he had a charming Voice, she taught him many agreeable French Songs.
HE was now in the Spring of Life, tall and well made. Health, Beauty, and Sprightliness were always present with him, and Mirth and Joy danc'd in his Eyes. These, and his little Accomplishments, made him caress'd by all, and were so remarkable, that even Madam Johnston has been frequently heard to say, Ma Foy, c'est un beau Garçon!—Voila de quoi faire un Joli Homme!—If Nannett was silent, she looked, and perhaps thought the more.—The Dial spoke not, but it made shrewd Signs.

THE Juice of the Grape is insipid, nor can yield a Spirit till fermented. In this State, the Vessel must be pierc'd, and a Vent given to the jarring Particles, or it will burst its Tenement.—The Hand of Experience knows when to stop this Chasm, —to fine it down, and give it the proper Time to acquire a Mellowness and Flavour that gladdens the Heart of Man, and adds Chearfulness and good Humour to every rational Company.—If Ignorance interferes

in the Management, the Wine will become sour, and of little or no Value.
IS there not somewhat of a fermenting Quality in human Nature? Or rather, is it not certain that there is?—Without this Fermentation, which the Passions only can give, Man would be but a moving Statue. 'Tis the Passions that open his Understanding.—They lay the Plan of all his Operations.—They conduct him first to Objects of Pleasure, and then branch out his Imagination to Glory—Honour—Riches. They polish him, and raise a Desire of loving, and of being loved.—In a Word, they alone, when justly guided, can make him a rational Creature.—If unheeded, and suffer'd to take an unnatural Bent, neither Fame nor Honour can result from them, and the Man becomes the Pest of Society instead of the Pleasure.
OUR little Hero was not form'd without these Passions. If from Inexperience, they sometimes hurry'd him into imprudent Acts, and brought him into dangerous Situations, he was the first to censure his own Conduct, and recur instantly to the Principles imbib'd in his Youth.—Of what Use these Passions and these Principles were to him, is too much a Part of this History, to be omitted in their proper Place.—

Since, therefore, it is impossible for me to act the impartial Historian, and omit the Consequences of these Passions, I hope the candid Reader will excuse the seeming Levity of this Chapter.—My Hero is not a perfect Hero.—He is young, and without Experience. He has the Seeds of Man in him, and consequently is faulty. Besides, as his whole Life turns on this Incident, I am compell'd to insert it, but hope the Moral will excuse the Tale.

THE Time was now come when Jack was to be tempted, and unwarily to yield. When he became criminal, he became unhappy.—Of late he took a particular Pleasure in Nannett's Company, and she, in Return, treated him with great Freedom, and with somewhat more than mere Complaisance. His Years prevented his seeing the secret Motives of her Kindness. He was happy, because she was fond of him; but her Fondness arose from a different Principle.—She lov'd.
How far this Passion will extend itself, few are unacquainted, and poor Nannett practis'd every female Wile to gain a Heart invincible to her Charms, only from Ignorance. Often has she told him, he ought, at his Age, to avoid blushing when he spoke to her, and be more a Man, than to tremble

at touching her Hand.—These and many other forcible Expressions she has reiterated, and sometimes even kiss'd him, but they only serv'd to give him a secret uneasy Pleasure, and a constant Desire of her Presence, without a Knowledge of the Meaning.—She remark'd his confus'd Behaviour, and found, she must either renounce all Shame, by speaking in direct Terms, or absolutely avoid him.—The Delicacy of her Sex as much forbid the one, as her violent Love did the other.
HER Invention was on the Rack, but at ast she remember'd a certain French Book, where a Lady is placed exactly in her Situation. To this dear Volume she turn'd, and determin'd to try the Experiment. She found Opportunities to oblige Jack to read most Part of it to her, but defer'd the Lecture of the interesting Scene, till the first Day Mr. Johnston and the Lads went a Hunting. That Time soon came, and the Evening before she whisper'd him, to avoid being of the Party, and they would finish that charming Story. He with Eagerness consenting, she told him how inconvenient it would be to read in his little Room, but, said she, as soon as they are all gone, if you will promise to be very secret, and make no Noise, you may come to

my Chamber, and we can read at our Ease.—He promis'd, and this Conversation ended.
IT was now June, and being fine Weather, all were ready for the Sport of the Field at Four in the Morning. Jack excus'd himself to Master Harry, on Account of a Book he was to finish, and a Letter to write to Mr. Kindly; and, slily slipping up into his Room, remain'd there till he saw them all at some Distance. With cautious Steps he quietly mounted the Back-Stairs, and found Nannett's Chamber Door on a Jarr ready to admit him. His Treading was not so light, but her attentive Ear heard him, and putting the Curtain back, in a low Voice she cry'd,—Lord bless me, Jack! Who would have expected you so early?—I thought to have been up and dress'd, and now you surprise a-body in Bed. Indeed I am quite asham'd of myself,—but—shut the Door, and sit down softly.—She then open'd the Curtain a little more, and Jack sat at some Distance. A Silence ensu'd for some Minutes, till at last he ventur'd to say something of the Book.—Well, said Nannett, look for it under my Pillow, and I'll read.—Jack search'd for some Time, but in vain; and, she calling him an aukward Fellow, rose

carelesly and soon found it.—Undoubtedly she had no Intention of exposing to his View her lovely Neck; for, no sooner had she caught his Eyes fix'd on that Part, and saw the Tumult it occasion'd in him, than with great Precipitation she cover'd it.— Her Head was once more laid on her Pillow, and the Book in her Hand.—If, said she, you keep so far off, you can't hear me, and you had better come and sit on the Bed-side.—The poor Boy, willing to oblige, carefully mov'd, but found her right Arm negligently thrown out. This Impediment he gently remov'd, but not before he had frequently kiss'd it. She call'd him a Fool, but her good Nature did not forbid this Sort of Folly.
JACK'S Spirits were up in Arms, so we must presume he was going to sit down improperly, otherwise she certainly would not have said—Bless me!—Why sure you an't so mad as to lie on the Bed;—But— if you are afraid your Shoes will make a Noise, and will absolutely do it, can't you pull them off?—His Shoes vanish'd in an Instant, and he placed himself where before he had no Intention.—

COME, come, said Nannett, let me make an End of my Story, but if you attempt to serve me, as Amyntor does his

Phillis, positively I shan't endure you,— but—here's one Kiss more to keep you quiet.—She then fix'd on the Page and began.—Thus situated were this happy Pair. Silence and Secrecy reign'd, and no Eyes to witness their Joys, but those of laughing Cupids, who hover'd round the inchanting Bower. Amyntor was all Desire and Love, but his invincible Modesty, oblig'd the equally enamour'd Phillis to supply by Management, what her Tongue could not utter. She insensibly conducted him to the Beginning of Charms, to which the Youth was an absolute Stranger.— Nannett continued to read, and, with great Judgment, laid the proper Emphasis on every Word; but at every tender or delicate Period, as many such there were, Jack became an exact Imitator, and frequently interrupted the Narration. She often wonder'd at his Assurance, and declar'd her Anger, but her Countenance did not seem to imply that Passion, and at last she was permitted to continue.—Too pressing Amyntor, too yielding Phillis!—The Time, the Place, and every Opportunity conspir'd with their mutual Inclinations.—A thousand Dalliances interven'd, 'till Prudence,— Virtue,—and Phillis were lost.


NANNETT would have proceeded, but Jack, still faithful to his Copy, prevented it by acting Amyntor.—I hope the Reader will not insist on too nice a Description of this Scene, for I am permitted but to add, that at last, as Reading was become useless, she clos'd the Book, and—I must close this Chapter.


CHAP. XIII.


Ah thoughtless Mortals! ever blind to Fate!
Too soon dejected, and too soon elate!
Sudden these Honours shall be snatch'd away,
And curs'd for ever this victorious Day.

DRYDEN'S VIRGIL.



THE Clock struck Seven, which rous'd them from their Dream of Happiness, to think on their Safety. Nannett was unwilling to part; but Jack, now more prudent, took an hasty Kiss or two, and got to his Room unperceiv'd. He now began to reflect on his Conduct, and he judg'd himself greatly criminal. He now remember'd Mr. Kindly's Precepts, which had for

some Time been neglected, and call'd to Mind his last Words of Calamity and Misfortunes, if he departed from Virtue. These Thoughts gave him extreme Uneasiness, but he found himself greatly reliev'd by resolving to be guilty no more, and to shun the Object. An unusual Gravity attended him the whole Day, which greatly disturb'd Nannett, as he gave her no Opportunity of inquiring into the Reason.
HE was extremely pleas'd with this Conquest over himself, but alas! he little knew his own Heart; and, as he was a Stranger to the Ways of Men, how could he possibly know that of Women?—Nannett, impatient to learn what passed in his Soul, waited in her Chamber till Two in the Morning, not doubting but Jack would find his Way there. The Disappointment extremely mortify'd her Pride; however, she determin'd at all Events, to have her Doubts satisfied, and resolutely ventur'd down, and got to his Bed-side. She prevented a Noise on his awaking, by telling her Name, and as she was undress'd, without more Ceremony slipp'd in, and took him in her Arms.
WHERE now were all his mighty Resolutions?—Where were all Mr. Kindly's moral Lessons?—Vanish'd,—Lost in the Obscurity of the Night, and in the Arms of

Youth and Beauty!—She made him many tender Reproaches, but her Love forgave all.—His Reflections that Day were quite of another Complexion to the former, and he even thought himself a Fool, for being more timorous than a Girl. Besides, he argu'd the Impossibility of Danger, or being discover'd; and, that if it was a Crime, he at most, was answerable but for Half; but the strongest Reason for continuing this Affair was, that he believed every Man would do the same, had he the same Opportunity.—Thus, his Understanding was quite defeated by, what he thought, good Reason.—How many are there, who, by such fallacious Arguments, persuade, or endeavour to persuade themselves into Evil, even contrary to their real Opinion? And how many are there, who are but too successful in their Attempts to deceive themselves?
HIS Amour went charmingly on for about six Weeks, nor could there be, in his Imagination, an happier Mortal.—He insensibly dropt all boyish Amusements, and was much less punctual and exact at School, than formerly. His Visage began to change, and the Roses in his Cheeks to fade; insomuch, that Madam Johnston really thought him out of Order, and very innocently directed

Nannett to take some Care of the poor Boy, and give him something warm, when he was in Bed. Nannett most punctually obey'd her Commands, but Jack grew paler notwithstanding.
MR. JOHNSTON, at last, observ'd an Alteration in Jack, and, for some Time, was of his Wife's Opinion; but, as Nothing could escape his Penetration, he perceiv'd that the Boy's Eyes sparkl'd, and his Face had an uncommon Glow, whenever Nannett enter'd the Room. He likewise remark'd a peculiar Pleasure in their Countenances, when they spoke to each other, and even when their Eyes chanc'd to meet, which they frequently did.—'Tis a Question would puzzle Monsieur de Moivre, Whether most Intrigues were began, or were discover'd by the Eyes? Certain it is, they are as apt to betray as seduce. If these faithless Companions have a Language to persuade us into secret Deeds, they have another to divulge it.—What Pity it is, they are placed in so conspicuous a Spot!
MR. JOHNSTON in his Youth was a Master of this Language, and read in their Hearts, what gave him extreme Pain. He was tortur'd with suspecting the worst, and reason'd himself into the Conduct he was to observe, should his Suspicions be well

grounded.—He knew, should his Resentment vent itself in Words, the Reputation of his Niece was lost, and the Character of his School would suffer a severe Wound.— To chastise the Boy, would answer but the same End.—To join them in Marriage was ridiculous, and, to suffer them to live peaceably in Iniquity was impossible.—For two Days was he thus agitated, before he could fix on a Scheme to save all Appearances, but particularly those that could affect his own Family.—When he had revolved his Plan, and taken a Resolution, his next Step was to satisfy his eager Doubts.
The third Morning, about Three o'Clock, he quietly stepp'd into Jack's Room. He examined the Bed, which he founded unruffled and cold, and immediately concluded Jack was in a warmer Place. He paused for a few Minutes to stifle his Indignation, and let the Hurry of his Spirits subside, and then quietly mounted to his Niece's Apartment. He gently open'd the Curtain, and found the happy criminal Pair lock'd in each other's Arms, bidding Defiance to all worldly Cares, for they were fast asleep. —For some Time he gazed with Astonishment, and scarcely credited the Evidence of his Eyes.—At last he stirred Nannett, who wakened with a tender Expression to

Jack; but when she perceiv'd her Uncle, she was just going to scream out, when he put his his Hand on her Mouth, and conjured her to make no Noise, but lie still.— Jack now opened his Eyes, but the Moment he beheld the old Gentleman, he hid himself under the Cloaths.
POOR Nannett put on a most supplicating Countenance, which her ready Tears greatly assisted. Mr. Johnston, with as much Coolness as he could collect, first desired her to pin her Tucker; and, Now, said he, Child, though you have been very foolish, yet I promise you, if you will keep your own Counsel, I shall do the same, and it shall for ever be a Secret, even from your Aunt.—So much Goodness gave her new Life, and she promised never more to transgress, and be all Obedience.—Dry your Eyes, my Dear, said he, you see I am not angry with you or Jack, so bid him get up and meet me in the Garden immediately; where we will consult how to manage this silly Affair.— When he was gone, Jack ventured to peep out, and was quite overjoyed to find Mr. Johnston in such good Humour, and much wonder'd at it. They were both extremely pleased, and imagined they even had his Consent to continue their agreeable Amusement.

—Jack soon dressed himself, and taking a tender Leave of his dear Nannett, promised to meet earlier the following Night; but alas! that Meeting never happened.
JACK got to the Garden as directed, but trembled at Mr. Johnston's Approach, who, assuming a Smile, gave the Boy not a little Courage.—'Well, Sir, said his Master, it seems you have lately passed your Time very chearfully, and turned over other Leaves besides Latin and Greek; however, I am not now here to upbraid you with Ingratitude, or with the Breach of all Laws, Human and Divine; neither shall I now correct you, or send you to Prison, and have you hang'd, as the Laws direct; but, as I shall always have it in my Power, so I shall certainly put it in Practice, except you will give me your most sacred Promise, to do whatever I shall order.' —'Sir, said Jack, with great Confusion, I really don't know how to appear before God or you, after my Transgressions; but I hope my sincere Repentance, with my most solemn Vow to obey all your Directions, will atone for my Crimes'— I know, reply'd Mr. Johnston, you abhor a Lye, therefore I will trust you. The last Letters I received from my Lord particularly mention you, about a Project

I had of sending you to London, of which he has approved. Now, Jack, if you will set out this Day, in the Manner I shall direct, I will pardon all, and put you in a Way of making your Fortune.' —'Sir, reply'd Jack, (who was fired at going to London) I have already given you my Oath to obey, and, to convince you of my Readiness, I am willing to set out this Minute.'

IN the first Place, said Mr. Johnston, I must insist on your not speaking a Syllable to Nannett, on any Account whatever, nor to any Person in the Family about what has happened. In the next Place, I desire you will press me this Morning for Leave to visit Mr. Wilson's Family, who have so often invited you.—Go that Road about a Mile, and then turn back through the Fields, which you know will, in about an Hour, lead you into the great Road to DUBLIN. On this Side the Windmill you will find my Man John with a Carr, who will have particular Orders to take Care of you, and you will follow his Directions. As I know you will believe me, I give you my Word and Honour, that I intend only your own Good; but it is absolutely necessary for your Peace and mine, that you promise

punctually to obey my Orders, and that on no Account you will ever write yourself, or cause any other Person to write to my Lord, Mr. Kindly, or me. These are the Conditions on which my Pardon is founded: If you transgress, be assur'd my utmost Rensentment will follow.

JACK threw himself on his Knees, and most solemnly vow'd, in the Presence of God, religiously to observe all his Directions; and rising, ask'd his Master what he intended to do with his Shirts, Books, and his other little Effects? But being assur'd he should find them all safe in Dublin, was quite easy on that Account.—Now, said Mr. Johnston, I am satisfy'd, and I hope you will have Reason to be content. Lest you may want Money on the Road, here is a Guinea, and more will be given you in Town.

AS they walk'd towards the House, Mr. Johnston gave him many good Lessons for his future Conduct.—He very earnestly recommended a modest, sober, and religious Life, as what only could give him true Joy and real Happiness.—He told him, that God sometimes permitted Good to come out of Evil and pray'd it might be so in the present Case; but, that no Man ought to depend that such a Grace would at all

Times be bestowed on us;—that, as the Mercy of God was great, so was his Jealousy; equally capable of forgiving young rash Sinners, as of punishing obstinate and unrepenting Offenders.
MUCH more was said on this Subject, and in so tender a Manner, as greatly to affect the Boy, and make a strong Impression on his Mind. Mr. Johnston concluded, with saying, You have not much of the common Irish Manner of speaking, but let me advise you to forget the little you have, and endeavour to speak like the People you live with, which will prevent your being often laugh'd at, and ridicul'd by the Ignorant and Vulgar, and none other can do it.—Your Name is quite Irish, but I shall call you JOHN CONYERS, in my Letters, and henceforward let that be your Name. And now, Mr. Conyers, I think we have fully settled this Matter; therefore go in, and behave as usual; but remember your Promise.

THEY got to the House before any of the Servants were up, so their Meeting was a Secret.—When Jack was alone, he began very seriously to reflect on his Situation. He was conscious of deserving very severe Punishment, and thank'd God Mr. Johnston had treated him so well.—On the other

Hand, he regretted parting with his dear Nannett, especially in the Manner he had promis'd, and had a violent Inclination to take one tender Farewel, but his Vow prevented him. The Injunctions laid on him, he thought very extraordinary; but the Dread of Punishment and Shame, and the Anger of my Lord and Mr. Kindly, made him acquiesce with Patience to these hard Terms. Besides, as he really had an entire Confidence in, and a Love for Mr. Johnston, he doubted not but he had good Reasons for what he ordered.
THO' his Effects were to meet him in Dublin, he had the wise Precaution of putting on two Shirts, and taking his Purse, which now contained but eleven Guineas. He likewise put in his Coat Pocket the little Box and Instructions given him by Mr. Kindly, and all the little Manuscripts he had. Thus dress'd, and fix'd in his Resolutions, he waited on Mr. Johnston, and begged his Leave to visit Mr. Wilson, who lived about four Miles to the West.—Mr. Johnston hesitated for some Time, but his Wife interceding, she obtained Permission, provided he promised to go Half a Mile round, and not cross the Ford which was sometimes dangerous.

IT seems Mr. Johnston had given Orders to John to go that Morning with a Carr to Dublin for an Hogshead of Wine; and, as he was an old faithful Servant, was the only Person he trusted with the Secret. He gave him his Instructions, and a Letter to his Brother, who was a Merchant of that City.—John had set out about Eight o'Clock, and Jack took a different Road about Nine. —He went off with tolerable Spirits; but, when he came to the appointed Turn, his Heart swelled, and the Thoughts of parting with Nannett, Master Harry, Billy, and all his dear Friends for ever, almost made him distracted, and obliged him to sit down and give Way to a Torrent of Tears.—At last the Thoughts of seeing DUBLIN and LONDON, and the Hopes of making his Fortune, throwing his Situation into a more favourable Light, he found Strength to proceed, and joyned old John about Eleven o'Clock.—The Man was prepared for him; and, under the Pretence of keeping him from the Sun, seated him on a Bundle of Straw on the Carr, and cover'd him with a Sort of Awning, so close, that no Passengers could see him, and then march'd on to Dublin, where he was well received by the Merchant.

PERHAPS the good-natured Reader may be desirous of knowing what passed at Portarlington when Jack was missed, and how Nannett and the Family behaved on this melancholy Occasion; and sorry I am, that it is not in my Power to gratify so reasonable a Curiosity. He may, if he pleases, suppose with me, that they sent next Day to Mr. Wilson's, and that their Surprize was great, when inform'd they had not seen or heard of him. No doubt, many were their Conjectures; some, I imagine, thought he had run away; but I apprehend the most probable and general Surmise was, that in crossing the Ford he was drown'd.
BE this as it will, I must, tho' with some Regret, leave this good Family, and follow my Friend JACK CONYERS through Scenes of a much different Nature.—The calm, tranquil Life he has hitherto led, must give Place to the Hurry and Bustle of the World. —Deceit, Craft, Flattery and Vice, must succeed to Lessons of Honour, Probity and Virtue.

DRYDEN'S VIRGIL.



HAPPY that Being, who sometimes permits himself to think seriously; who suffers his Imagination deliberately to reflect on external Objects, and internally apply those Lessons of Morality, and Instruction that may be drawn from every Action of Man—Vice trails with it those Marks, that shew us its Odiousness, as some poisonous Animals carry their Antidote.— Affluence and Plenty are not generally productive of such Thoughts; for, in that Situation, we are apt to look no farther than ourselves, nor conceive the Possibility of being wretched and unhappy, till we have experienced some of its Bitters.—There is a pleasing and a useful Sensation, in the Soul, at viewing and commiserating the Distresses of the Unfortunate. The more we have pitied and raised our Tenderness and Charity to others, the happier we find ourselves, should Distress and Penury, visit us

in its Rounds—Independent of the Christian Duty of Compassion, this Consideration alone, makes it good to have been in Trouble.

JACK, tho' tenderly treated by the Merchant, and now in a large City where Variety of unaccustom'd Objects presented themselves to his View, yet melancholy Ideas fill'd his Mind. To abandon and be abandon'd by those Friends he had so sincerely loved—To live amongst Strangers in a distant Country, and to begin to labour and work for the Bread he was to eat, were to him most dreadful Vicissitudes of Fortune; and what he imagin'd, were peculiar to himself. In these gloomy Reflections, he acknowledged his manifold Offences, and in his fervent Prayers, which had lately been neglected, most heartily begg'd Forgiveness. He read Mr. Kindly's Instructions to his Son, over and over, and made the properest Observations on them in his Power.
AS I have now some spare Time, it cannot be better employ'd, than laying before my Reader the Instructions so often mention'd.—Should he be wise enough not to stand in Need of these Precepts, I beg he will pass them over, and skip on to the mere Narration.



To my Son John Kindly.



Bounty Hall.

My dear Child,

WHEN you reflect on the Relation I bare to you, and on my Tenderness and Affection, you must be convinc'd that all my Care and Pains is to endeavour to make, and perhaps see you an happy and a worthy Man.—You are now to begin a new Scene of Life, where, instead of the Guardianship of a fond Father you must be guided and directed by so dangerous a Tutor as yourself—Tho' you must be far remov'd from my Presence, yet, I conjure you by every sacred Tye, to think on your Father and the Advice he now gives you.
BE careful in observing every Duty of RELIGION. You will find it the surest, and perhaps the only Way to keep Peace and Content in your Heart, and a Serenity and Chearfulness in your Countenance—By being a Man, be not asham'd of being a Christian.

CANDOUR, Integrity and Gratitude, are some of the strongest Links that bind Men to each other. When these

are absent, Suspicion, Fraud and Deceit, will fill each Breast, and make us rather Companions for the wild Inhabitants of the Forest, than Associates to Animals, who boast superior Reason.
YOU are to live in the World.—You are to study the large Volume of Mankind.—Whilst thus employ'd, forget not that Mankind are studying you.— Nature has given you an easy flexible Temper, therefore guard against the Charms of Flattery.—I know you will avoid the Profligate and Prophane: Shun likewise the Demure, the Precise, and the Very Godly. — Experience demonstrates that Hypocrisy, Cunning and Deceit, generally lurk under it, and that the Righteous overmuch, have other Schemes to work out, besides their Salvation.
WITH Virtue, Truth and Justice, which I trust you will preserve, there are Duties of Society that give Beauty and Harmony, and therefore must not be neglected.
A TENDERNESS for our Fellow-Creatures, a compassionate Turn for their Misfortunes, and Pity for their Weaknesses, are what we owe ourselves and them.—By not paying this Debt, we renounce our Claim to Humanity.

POLITE Behaviour and Complacency of Manners places every Action in the most advantageous Light, and adds irresistible Grace to every Word and every Motion.—Be sincere in such a Conduct, and suffer not your Lips to give the Lye to your Heart.—There is a Medium to be followed even to Persons we have an ill Opinion of.
AS a general good Behaviour is necessary to, and required by all, you cannot fail of being remarkably so to some particulars; but avoid making Friendships, till by Time you are convinced they deserve your's.—When you have found a Friend, detest the old and false Maxim of living with him as tho' he may become an Enemy.

GO not into the Way of Temptation; for, believe me, it will but too often fall in your's. Resolution is strong; but the strongest is lodg'd in a frail Body, therefore depend not too much upon it, but, rather owe your Safety to a timely Flight.
IN your Dress, avoid as much as possible the Gaudy and Fluttering, but in the Neat and Clean, endeavour to be remarkable. A Carefulness in properly setting off the Person, is commendable

and useful. It argues a Desire of pleasing, and gratifies the Eye of every Beholder. A Propriety in Dress, and a certain Sobriety of Deportment, free from Affectation and Formality, will always add Weight to your Conversation, and make it sought after.
COMPANY and Chearfulness are necessary, and of infinite Use; but a constant Jollity and Mirth betrays such a Levity in the Mind, that your Presence will never be desir'd but merely to divert others, whose Regard ceases the Instant the Laughter is over.—Should your Wit offend, be assured of an Enemy for ever.
AS your Inclinations lead you to the Study of the Laws, you will soon perceive the Strength of the Foundation on which the British Constitution is built.— You will soon observe the Happiness of that Kingdom, where the different Ranks of Men have their different Operations, all coinciding and centering in the Preservation of the Whole.—Let your Heart and your Hand be always ready to support this Structure.—It has often been in Danger, and suffered mighty-Revolutions; but, as it is now fully repaired by a PROTESTANT ARCHITECT,

be it your Care, as much as in you lies, to defend it from every Foreign Political, and from every Domestick wicked Attempt.
AMBITION and Pride are Crimes of the most dangerous Tendency, yet, like Opiates, a small Quantity is sometimes necessary, as a large one gives the Patient up to Frenzy and Madness, and, in the End, destroys him.—To have these in a just Degree, will raise a Desire of excelling, and prevent a Meanness of Conduct.
A POET says, 'There is a Pleasure in being mad, which none but mad Men know.'—Be it so, but desire not to experience it. Rather try what Pleasure Common Sense will afford.—She will instruct you in Oeconomy, and in that proper Management of your Fortune, that will bid Defiance to a Goal, and make your Sleep truly a Blessing.—She will teach you the right Use of Learning, and shew the Folly of being impertinent with it.—She will hold a Mirror to your Person, and point out the Absurdity of being vain of it.—She will advise, direct, and shew you the World in its true and genuine Colours, and give you that Taste, which Ignorance,

Pride and Folly, will ever be Strangers to.
LEARN, if possible, to be content with the Station Heaven has allotted you, and endeavour to attain that Sort of Philosophy which gives Patience and Resignation in all Sorts of Calamities.— The happiest of Beings not only are subject to them, but almost daily feel them in different Shapes.—To be a Master of this truly noble Science, believe me, the Heart must be unconscious of Guilt, and a Rectitude of Thought must dwell in it.—In a Word, let your Intentions and your Schemes of Life be always founded in Virtue and Honour; but, whilst human and prudential Means are pursu'd, submit the Issue, with all Humility, unto that BEING, who is incapable of Error or Falshood, and into whose Hands I chearfully submit you.

JOHN KINDLY.



AS often as Jack read over these Lessons, he found his Cares to lighten, and received such Strength to support himself, as made him determine to pursue them as exactly as he could.—He had now been in Dublin about a Month, and had received all the Effects he left in Portarlington. The Merchant

having prepared all Things for his Expedition, and equipp'd him tolerably well in Cloaths, gave him Five Guineas, and a Letter to his Correspondent Mr. Joshua Strong, of Throgmorton-Street, and embark'd him on board the Hibernia, bound for London.

I HOPE it will not be expected I should furnish my Readers with the Adventures of this Voyage of ten Days, as there happen'd but the common Occurrences on such Occasions; but I am strongly inclin'd to present them, according to the Practice of other wise Authors, with a most extraordinary and surprising Dream Jack had the first Night.—He dream'd—But I beg Pardon, for I find myself at this Instant so drowsy, that I must request my kind Reader will follow my Example, and by taking a Nap, dream the Remainder of this Chapter.



CHAP. XV.


When Pleasure stumbles in our Way,
Our best Resolves too oft' decay.
Frail Nature prompts, and giddy Youth
Falls into Crimes, in spite of Truth.
ANONIMOUS.


MR. STRONG had by Post received a full Account of Jack, and what he was destin'd for, so that when he appear'd with his Letter, he was received with a Sort of Civility that gave him some Uneasiness. Mr. Strong, was at Dinner, and having asked him a few trifling Questions, desir'd him to go to the Kitchen and get some Victuals. He bore this Indignity tolerably well, for his Appetite did not permit his quarrelling with Punctilios. In the Evening some more Questions were put to him, and was told he should be taken next Morning where he was to live. It seems Mr. Strong had had Time to prepare Matters.
THIS was not the pleasantest Night Jack pass'd in his Life, but the Morning at last came that was to solve some Doubts. Mr.

Strong took his Hat and Cane, and desir'd Jack to follow him. As they walk'd he told him they were going to Mr. Champignon's the Weaver in Spittle Fields, with whom he had agreed to bind him Apprentice. You may, said Mr. Strong, stay seven or eight Months on Trial; but I dare say you will like your Situation so well, that you will have Reason to thank your Friends. —Jack, though not quite pleas'd, was glad to find Matters no worse, and with more Chearfulness continued his March to the Weaver's.
MR. STRONG entering, cry'd, 'Well, Monsieur, here is the Boy I spoke to you about; take him, and be sure dont keep him idle.'—'Ha hah, said Champignon, Parbleau he be a ver pritty Garçon, and I sure you muste workè ver well, for be gar si he no Travail he fall avè de ver good Soupe-maigre!—'That's right, said Mr. Strong, no Work, no Meat; but I hope he'll prove a good Boy, so, Monsieur, your Servant,—I'll call on you as I go by.'— 'Serviteur, Serviteur, Monsieur de Strang, cry'd Champignon, as you plese call en pessant.'—Jack eye'd his new Master, and could scarcely forbear laughing at the Oddity of his Figure. He was about Sixty-five or Seventy Years of

Age, tall and very thin. His swarthy Skin did not seem to belong to what it cover'd, and his Cheek-Bones, in particular, discover'd a violent Inclination to escape through. He had on an old greasy Stuff Gown, and a double mill'd Cap, that perhaps was formerly Scarlet. In short, Jack thought he was bound Apprentice to a Skeleton, but a certain good natur'd Smile, and an agreeable Vivacity in the old Man, gave him some Prospect of being better than he imagin'd.
MONSIEUR Champignon, was one of the Million whom the Religious Wisdom of LEWIS the Fourteenth compell'd to visit England and other Protestant Countries, and who brought with them many useful Arts and Manufactures. He was a Man of great Application and Industry, which, with great Saving for a Course of Years, made him worth about Twenty Thousand Pounds. He had a Gaiety in his Temper, and such a Fund of natural good Understanding, that his Company was extremely agreeable to many eminent Merchants. His Wife was a good Sort of old Woman; but his only Child Mademoiselle TONTON, was a most lively and pritty Girl of Twenty-four Years of Age. Her Complexion was not of the brightest, but her sparkling

Eyes, and her good Shape, made her a very desirable Object. Her Father, from the Stinginess of his Temper, had disappointed her of two very good Matches, and the scandalous Chronicle of the Neighbourhood said, she had taken a proper Revenge.
CHAMPIGNON was so whimsical, that he scarcely ever spoke French, and his English was such a Medley, as to occasion frequent Laughter. When he was ask'd, Why he spoke not better English, he always answer'd,—De par tout les Diables! — How you avè me speak so better Englis? Sacre Chien! I avè live dans Londres no more as Forty Year, but avec de Time, me sal avè de Conversation, Piff—Paff— so well as Monsieur me lor Merè.

JACK was employ'd in the usual Business of a junior Apprentice, and in weaving Ribbons, which he did tolerably well, but found he had not a natural Call to be ty'd to a Loom.
IT would be impertinent to attempt to entertain the Reader with the many arch Tricks Jack play'd his new Master, or with the Mirth Monsieur Champignon's English afforded. He was extremely passionate, and often call'd Jack a Jean Fou-re, an Irland son-ma-biche, and many other

whimsical Names that always excited Llaughter.
HE had now liv'd with Mr. Champignon above Twelve Months, and was pretty well reconciled to the Family, whose Love he had got by Songs, and a thousand Irish Stories. Miss, in particular, was greatly diverted with his agreeable Chat, and he overheard her one Morning, tell her Maid; That considering Conyers was Irish, he was the prettiest young Fellow she ever saw in her Life.—Though his Manner of speaking was greatly improved, yet there remained enough of his Country to be severely banter'd by Miss Tonton. She often insisted on his making Bulls and Blunders. She laugh'd at the Words, Unwell — Big Coat, — E're Yesterday, and the like. — Jack, who was now become pretty free, ask'd her, if she understood him when he spoke.—'Yes, said she, I comprehend your Meaning well enough; but you have such unaccountable Phrases, one had need of an Irish Expositor.'—'I'm glad, Madam, said Jack, you are pleas'd to allow I speak so as to be comprehended, but a Gentleman, the other Day, in our Warehouse cry'd out, "Did no body see any body take up never a Hat."—'I beg, Madam,

you will be so good to explain this English Phrase; for, upon my Sowl, I cannot.'—'Upon my Sowl! said she, and laugh'd violently at his Tone, without answering his Question.'
SUCH Sort of Conversation happen'd frequently, and was equally amusing, but as he artfully suffer'd her to have the Superiority in every Argument, and even ask'd her Advice and Instruction, she conceived a vast Opinion of his uncultivated Genius, and his natural good Parts.—These Sort of Beginnings, generally lead to, and are but the Forerunners of Thoughts, not so proper to be plainly set down.—These impertinent Thoughts but too often occur'd,— Jack had them not,—Guess who then?
MISS TONTON was one Morning at her Toilet very judiciously adjusting her Headdress before she fix'd her Stays. Young Conyers, passing her Chamber, was perceiv'd by the Reflection of her Glass, and calling him in a great Hurry, begg'd he'd look down her back for a Flea that teaz'd her immoderately. Jack, very innocently, examin'd the Part, and declar'd he saw nothing.—Lord, said Tonton, you're such an unhandy Booby, you'll let the Creature escape, but look sharp, Jack, I beg of you.—Jack look'd, but his Imagination

being warm'd by the Touch, his Understanding became the clearer.—Now, cry'd he, I see it.—There it hops, faith 'tis a Swinger.—He then vigourously pursu'd the flying Animal, which, traversing the whole Plain of her Back, took its Course to the Eminencies in Front, where it afforded a most delightful Chase. It skip'd from Hill to Hill, practis'd all the Craft of the Hare, but Jack was so keen a Sportsman, that he rested not till he had fairly caught it.
ASSOCIATES in Amusements become Intimates, and frequently form Friendships. 'Twas so in the present Case. Tonton began to be extremely fond of Jack's Company, and found so many Opportunities to hunt, that one would imagine she had collected all the Fleas in the Parish, to afford him Diversion. Her Maid Bersheba, who was old and ugly, prevented many an Evening's Sport, so she was oblig'd to make Use of her as a Whipper-in, or as a Groom to hold the Horses. By this notable Contrivance, Jack was frequently introduc'd when the Family were in Bed, and stay'd till they were near rising, when he quietly retir'd through the old Maid's Room, whose Hey-day of the Blood was not over, but sometimes mutiny'd in the Matron's

Bones.—It seems poor Bersheba was likewise subject to Fleas, and the Hunting them became not a little troublesome to Jack. It chagreen'd him much, and made Tonton very uneasy.—At last he obtain'd a long Respite, but not in the Manner he chose, for he was taken extremely ill, and a violent Fever ensu'd. No doubt he wanted not proper Care, and in Six Weeks he began to return to his Senses, and a little to recover.
THE first Use he made of his Reason, was to confess the Justice of the Punishment for his repeated Crimes.—Bounty-Hall, Portarlington, his Friends, and all their good Advice, now came rushing into his Thoughts with such Force, that he relapsed, and had like never to have given me the Opportunity of writing his History. His Youth and good Constitution at length prevail'd, and all Danger was over, except what might proceed from his extreme Weakness, or falling into a Consumption. He recover'd so slowly, that the Doctor, like his Brethren, when they know not what else to do, advis'd a Change of Air for a Month or two. Champignon was one of the few Frenchmen of Substance, who had not a Country House, and to take Lodgings and maintain Jack, would be attended

with an Expence he by no means could bring himself to think of.
MR. VILLENEUF, a very eminent Merchant in Black-Fryars, was an intimate Friend, and had frequently diverted himself with Jack, whose pertinent Answers and good Understanding, made him a Sort of Favourite.—'Champignon, said he one Day, Why don't you send poor Conyers to the Country?—The Lad will die here, and his Funeral will cost you more than a Month's Lodging.'—'Ha, Ha, said Champignon, I do no such a-ting.—Parbleu I send Jean to de Diable—to Monsieur de Strang.—Dat Gentilman he never come say, Champignon, how Jean Conyer do?—Monsieur de Strang say noting, do noting—Poor Champignon muste do tout.—Ventrebleu! Je crois dat de Monde tink me diablement richè!—I tellê you, Monsieur Villeneuf, poor Champignon sall dye, alors you will see, you will regardé all my pauvre Richesse.'—'A d'autres, said Villeneuf, I know you better. Besides, if Mr. Strong be a Brute, I hope my Friend Champignon is not?—But I shall make this Matter easy, and honest Conyers shall not be lost.—Send him Tomorrow to my House at Greenwich, where he may be a Companion for my sober

melancholy Son, and perhaps do each other good.'—Champignon was not averse to this Proposal, and Jack, with his Trunk, were put into a Coach, and sent off next Day.
MR. VILLENEUF, the Son, was a Gentleman of Twenty-four Years of Age. He passionately lov'd Reading and Retirement, was extremely good natur'd and charitable; but had a Gloominess in his Temper, that made him averse to much Company and Mirth. His Father, who had no other Child, was oblig'd to indulge him in his Humour, and supply him liberally with Money to gratify his generous Spirit. His large Fortune could very well afford this Expence.
JACK was as happy as his disturb'd Thoughts would permit, which were ever reflecting on his past Conduct, and upbraiding him with Actions of which he dreaded the Consequence.—Repentance, he thought, might avert a further Punishment, and set himself seriously to think of it.— He knew, that truly to repent, he must lead a new Life, and avoid his former, and all other Crimes.—But how difficult! what Struggles had he to forget Nannett and Tonton! he could not avoid remembring the very Thing he wanted to be blotted from

his Memory; then how could he say he would forget them?—No, but as he could not prevent the Intrusion of Thought, he was determin'd to refrain from actual Evil. As this was the utmost he could bring himself to, he rested satisfy'd that this Resolution would hold firm.
THE first Week at Greenwich was not extreamly pleasant, as young Mr. Villeneuf, seldom spoke to, or seem'd to regard him, but as the Apprentice of a Weaver, for whom his Father had some Value. Jack perceived the Reason of this Coolness, and by Degrees stole in a Latin Sentence; and some judicious Observations, but in such Language and Accent (for he had quite lost the Irish Tone) that surpriz'd the young Gentleman, and made him desirous of a more intimate Acquaintance. This he easily accomplished, and as Jack's Health and Spirits encreas'd, he made great Progress in the Affections of Mr. Villeneuf.

THE old Gentleman had determin'd to send his Son to Paris for a Year or two, that by Travel, and a different Climate and Company, he might be brought insensibly to act like other Men. He found his Son was much pleas'd with Jack, and propos'd his going with him as a kind of Servant, of whom he might at Times make a Companion.

The young Gentleman express'd his Satisfaction, and Conyers was vastly delighted at seeing a little more of the World, and not be oblig'd to return to the perpetual Motion of the Shuttle.

I MUST leave the Management of Monsieur Champignon to the old Gentleman, and bid adieu to Spittle-Fields, Tonton and Bersheba, for in three Months Mr. Villeneuf and Conyers found themselves in the Capital of France.




CHAP. XVI.


The Learned, full of inward Pride,
The Fops of Outward show Deride;
The Fop, with Learning at Defiance,
Scoffs at the Pedant, and the Science:
The Don, a formal, solemn Strutter,
Despises Monsieur's Airs and Flutter;
While Monsieur mocks the formal Fool
Who looks, and speaks, and walks by Rule.

Britain, a Medley of the Twain,
As pert as France, as grave as Spain,

In Fancy wiser than the Rest,
Laughs at them both,—

GAY.



JACK was now in his Ninteenth Year, of a good Stature, good Complexion, and, when dress'd, was a very genteel and handsome Fellow. His Eyes were black and sprightly; he had a most agreeable Smile, and something so easy in his Manner, that he prepossessed every one in his Favour, almost at first Sight. When he spoke, it was with great Modesty, but his Learning and good Sense made him heard with Pleasure. He had found out the

grand Secret of Conversation, which was to speak seldom, but to the Purpose, and he had likewise learn'd to get the better in an Argument, by sometimes giving it up.

HIS fix'd Allowance from Mr. Villeneuf was but small, but he equipp'd him with decent Cloaths, ruffled Shirts, and from Time to Time with Money sufficient to dine at a good Ordinary, and be always clean and neat. Mr. Villeneuf generally went out about Ten in the Morning, and return'd to his Lodgings about Five in the Evening, except he went to the Comedy, but never expected Conyers till about Eight or Nine o'Clock. Jack always attended when he was dressing, but was of little Use, as a French Footman performed all that Operation.
MR. VILLENEUF had a Fencing and a Dancing Master, rather because it was the Fashion, and that his Father insisted on it, than for any Use they might be of to him. The Gentlemen constantly attended, but Conyers principally received the Benefit of their Instructions. He likewise was very diligent at a Neighbouring Academy for Riding. This was of infinite Advantage, as it strengthened his Limbs, and gave him a Carriage that still added to the Gracefulness of his Person. When his Curiosity

was pretty much gratify'd, he applied closely to the best French Authors, making their History and Language familiar to him. He examined and enquired, as far as he was able, into their Laws, their Customs and Manners; and made such Observations, that more learned Travellers need not have been asham'd of. He had a Genius for Figures, and made himself a tolerable Master of some Branches in Mathematicks. In a Word, he took Care to be fully employ'd.
HIS young Master, or rather his Friend, had Books enough, and in Conversation gave him many Hints which he improv'd. One Night at Supper, Villeneuf told him, he wonder'd at his staying so much in the House; and that he ought to go more into the World! 'You are always said he, poring over Books, and advising me against what you practise yourself.'—'I confess, Sir, said Conyers, it is but too true. I am necessitated to act like the Gascoin; for, not having it in my Power to read the Great, I must content myself with the small World, as I find it in Books.'— Pray, said Mr. Villeneuf, how did the Gascoin manage?—'Why, Sir, reply'd Conyers, the Gascoin was just as poor a Fellow as I am, but he took it into his Head to be industrious, and amuse himself

with selling Water in Paris. An old Friend met him and his Pitchers, and was vastly surpriz'd that a Gentleman of his Noble Blood, could so demean himself, as to follow so low an Occupation. Lord! reply'd the Gascoin, you quite mistake the Matter, for I am a Man of great Importance, and such a Favourite at Court, that the King has granted me the Waters of the Sein, but, as I have not found a Chap to buy the Whole at once, you see I am oblig'd to retail it.—'So, said Villeneuf, the Moral of the Story is, that your Poverty prevents your following my Advice; but henceforward, that shall be no Obstacle. My Appointment is more than I possibly know how to spend, and must desire your Assistance in the Management of Part of it. To begin, take these Fifty Pieces, and command more when they are gone.'—Sir, said Conyers, I own I meant to beg a little Money, but could never imagine your Generosity and Goodness, extensive and great as they are, could lead you into such an Act, that my poor Services can never repay.'

CONYERS, like Numps in the Comedy, was quite another Creature with Money in his Pocket, and so elate, that he could not avoid imparting his good Fortune to Madam

Commode, the Milliner where they lodg'd. She rejoic'd exceedingly, and extoll'd Mr. Villeneuf's Generosity to the Skies, but still insinuated, that the Bounty was vastly lessen'd, when the Worth and Value of the Receiver was consider'd.—Many were the Compliments and Encomiums bestow'd on him by the good Woman and her fair Daughter, Madamoiselle MADELAIN. This young Lady was bless'd with peculiar Eloquence, and such a Fluency of Speech, that Conyers press'd her Acceptance of a Couple of Lewis d'Ors, which, by some accidental Words, he found she stood in Need of. With great Difficulty she consented, but assur'd him, it was owing to his irresistable Politeness.—He imagin'd sometimes, she was troubled with Fleas, but he found those of Paris more nimble than those he had before hunted; for, though he often attempted, yet he never could catch one of Madelain's.
HE din'd most commonly at a neighbouring Hotel frequented by very good Company, where he had the Honour of hearing the English pretty severely handled, particularly by Monsieur MAQUEREAU, and the Chevalier FANFARON.—'I can't conceive, said Maquereau, how London maintains itself, for most of the Inhabitants

transport themselves to Paris.'—'True, cry'd Fanfaron, those English of some Understanding, know they can never improve but by our Company.'—'I can't blame them, reply'd the other, for it shews some Glimmering of a good Taste. The English, continued he, have that plodding Turn, and that Sort of blunt Stupidity, that enables them to make Money, and as foolishly to throw it away. Were it not for their Guineas, their Company would be insupportable.'—'It must be confess'd, said the Chevalier, that their Purse is the best furnish'd Part about them. They are aukward and clumsey, and have not the least Spark of French Politeness.'—'I'm sure, said Maquereau, (raising his Shoulders) we take great Pains to make them reasonable Animals, by sending such a constant Provision of Cooks, Milliners, Taylors, Footmen, Silks, Embroideries, and a Million of other useful Ingredients in the Composition of a fine Gentleman or Lady; and so ungrateful are the Creatures, that they send us nothing in Return.'— Fo—re, cry'd the Chevalier, what the Devil have they to send us? So Monsieur BALLANCE comes in Person to return their Thanks.'—Many more vain and impertinent Remarks pass'd between them; and

the Chevalier concluded, by saying, It must be allowed, France is the Nation in the World, where People see good Manners and true Politeness.

CONYERS was very uneasy at this Conversation; but Monsieur DE PENSE, an elderly Gentleman, took a Glass of Wine, and said to him, 'Mr. Englishman, I have the Honour to drink your Health. 'Tis the English Fashion, and I love it the better. I have great Obligations to the English, and regard them as a brave and generous People. As for their Politeness, I swear they have more than what you have seen this Day at Table.'—'Sir, said Conyers, I am very glad to find so much in one Gentleman, and am disappointed at not discovering the same in all.'— How, Sir! cry'd the Chevalier, in an half Angry Tone.—Sir, reply'd Jack very briskly, you'll be so good to indulge me two Words, before your Warmth encreases. Gentlemen, continued he, I am in Paris by Command; therefore, am not one of those who come meerly to learn Fashions. All Nations have Fools in Abundance.— English Fools go Abroad, because they have Money, and perhaps the Fools of this Country stay at Home, because they have none. I frequently meet them, and

sometimes dine with them, and, if you will take their Words, they are Men of Taste and Politeness; and, to convince you of it, they will tell you the English are stupid and barbarous. They'll say the rudest Expressions with the most respectful Bow, and call it Good Manners. I own, Gentlemen, my Ignorance cannot comprehend the vast Politeness of such a Conduct, but my little Experience has taught me not to judge of a whole Nation, by a few recent bad Samples.'—Fanfaron and Maquereau swell'd with Choler, but Pensé, in a Sort of peremptory Manner, desir'd them to be easy, and added,—'I am asham'd of all this. Every one here knew this young Gentleman was English, and every one of us ought to strive who could most oblige him. If Gentlemen will strike the Ball, they must expect it will rebound, and I doubt not but the young Englishman is as capable of handling a Racket as either of you; but by G— he that offends him, by Design, offends me.' —'I offend the Gentleman? cry'd the Chevalier, I hope I have more good Manners.'—'I am truly sorry, said Maquereau, any Pleasantry of mine should offend a Stranger, much more one of so respectable a Nation as England, and I

hope the Gentleman will be so good to grant me his Pardon.'—'Sir, said the Chevalier to Jack, I ask the same with the utmost Sincerity, and flatter myself the Good Nature, so peculiar to the English Nation, will demonstrate itself on this unhappy Occasion; for, be assur'd, Sir, we had not the least Intention of affronting you, or our dear Friend Monsieur de Pensé.' —Mutual Compliments having pass'd, the Affair was finally adjusted, but Mr. Pensé begg'd a further Acquaintance with Conyers, for he was vastly satisfy'd with his Conduct.
AT Supper, Jack acquainted Mr. Villeneuf with his Adventure, who seem'd extremely pleas'd he had come off so well.— 'That idle Partiality to our Country, and the despising all others, said Mr. Villeneuf, gives Rise to a thousand Quarrels. Do not our vulgar Countrymen most heartily abuse the French, and all other Nations? And I believe many of our Great-ones do the same.'—'In this, Sir, said Jack, you may very justly say,

The Great Vulgar, and the Small,
Differ in little,—if at all.


The highest and lowest Class only vary in their Vices, by the Manner of committing them. They have their Amours, and are equally gratified.—One may drink Champaign or Burgundy to Excess, and the other be as happily drunk with Beer or Gin.—One may game for a Thousand Pounds, and the others be as eager, and cheat as much in Play for Two-pence.' —'But, said Mr. Villeneuf, in Swearing and Cursing, as their Capacities are equal, they are equal in every Part.'—'In abusing the French, said Conyers, they may have a Shadow of Reason, because they are always publick or private Enemies; but what can be said, Sir, when they abuse and insult a whole Kingdom, govern'd by the same Monarch, the same Laws, and inhabited by the same People, as themselves?'—'I suppose, said Villeneuf, you mean the People of IRELAND, for I know you have a warm Side to it.'—'Sir, said Conyers, I shall not deny it, neither do I think it a criminal Warmth; for he who wishes well to a Part of his Majesty's faithful Subjects, ought to do so to the Remainder.'—'Not only so, reply'd Villeneuf, but is bound in Duty to wish well, that is, to endeavour to convert the bad ones. Your Observation on the Insults

offer'd the Irish, is, I think, rather too general, and holds true; but, with Regard to what you term the great and small Vulgar, Gentlemen of a certain Education, think differently, and are not Slaves to old Popular Errors and Prejudices. However, I believe you will confess, that the infamous Practices of some of the Irish, don't much contribute to remove the Partiality.'—''Tis too true, Sir, said Conyers, and many pay for their Pranks with their Lives, and die suddenly in Tyburn Road. If a poor Wretch has, or takes on himself a Name, something like the common Irish, every News-Paper charges him to the Account of Ireland, when perhaps some other Part was intitled to the Honour. This has often made me wish, that the Hibernians had a Gallows erected for their own proper Use, as they have here for the Normans; and, who knows, but a certain Shame might operate more forcibly than the Severity of Laws.'

Well, well, cry'd Villeneuf, I am for the Ford, let it fit whom it will. As for the Abuse and Banter bestow'd in general on the Irish Tone, or Manner of Speaking, I think it falls only on those who give it; but as you seem to interest yourself

about them, and I believe know little of the Conduct of England, with Regard to that Kingdom, I shall give you, some Time or another, a short Tract on that Subject, which I have chiefly collected from the Observations of my Father.— Conyers return'd him many Thanks, and Mr. Villeneuf desiring him to keep up his Acquaintance with Monsieur Pensé, retir'd to his Chamber.


CHAP. XVII.


Of all the Follies we can boast,
None, sure, can be so strong,
As pay a Fool to rule the Roast,
And guide our Children wrong.
What Man, who plows the fertile Soil,
And hopes Reward for Cares,

Will call the Crows to reap his Toil,
And be content with Tares?


ANONIMOUS.



NEXT Morning Conyers paid a Visit to Monsieur Pensé, and was genteely received. The usual Compliments being over, I doubt not, Sir, said he, but you 'were greatly shock'd, Yesterday, at the

Impertinencies of the two Scoundrels; but, as you very justly said, that you would not brand a whole Nation for the Faults of a few, I believe I can strengthen your good Sense, by informing you who those Men are.'—'I am sure, Sir, said Conyers, they are Persons of low Minds, which made my Resentment fall the lighter; but I must own my Obligations to you, for extricating me from an Affair that might have been as troublesome as necessary.'—'I promise you, said Pensé, you owe me nothing, and you will be convinc'd of it, when I have the Pleasure of being better known to you. At present, permit me to give you a short Account of those Gentlemen who gave themselves so many Airs.'


FANFARON was very early dubb'd a Knight of the famous and ancient Order of INDUSTRY. It is impossible to inform you of his many Exploits in France, Italy, and in England, where I had the Honour of meeting him and Maquereau at a Gaming-Table, and detected them of using loaded Dice: Fanfaron fell to my Share, and Maquereau to a Friend. The Discipline of the Cane and Kicking lasted a full half Hour, and was so entertaining,

that they have ever since done me the Honour of being extremely complaisant.
THE Chevalier got acquainted in London with Mrs. Smith, the Wife of an Italian Merchant. She was a most charming Woman, and her Husband was extremely fond. His Business calling him to Leghorn, he prudently settled his Affairs, and made his dear Wife sole Executrix, and divided his Fortune between her and a Child. Poor Mr. Smith went off, and his tender Consort would have been inconsolable, had not the good-natur'd Fanfaron comforted her in her Afflictions.
AT last the Chevalier persuaded her into a Scheme to make their Joys more compleat, and not so liable to be interrupted by the Curiosity of a Husband. He very dexterously forg'd a Letter from the Correspondent at Leghorn to Mrs. Smith, full of kind Expressions and Friendship, and the great Difficulty he was under, by being oblig'd to mention the Loss of so worthy and good a Man as Mr. Smith, who took a Fever, and, in Spite of all Assistance, and the Skill of Physicians, died in his Arms the Ninth Day, confirming a Testament made in England.


MRS. SMITH was now a Widow, and acted that Part to such Perfection, that her Relations thought she could not long survive.'—'Good Heaven! cry'd Conyers, I shudder at the Consequences.'— Well, Sir, said Pensé, notwithstanding her mighty Grief, her Weeds and Administring to the Will were not forgotten. In fine, she call'd in the Debts, sold off the Stock in Trade, the House, and every Thing belonging to it, and finding herself in Possession of Six Thousand Pounds in Cash, very fairly bid Adieu to her Husband, her Child, her Father, and all her Relations, and flew with her beloved Fanfaron to this famous City.
POOR Mr. Smith return'd soon after to England. If his Pleasure was great at the Thoughts of meeting his dearest Wife, what were the Torments he endur'd, when he found he had not only lost her, but was reduc'd to Beggary? Words cannot express his melancholy Situation, and the Manner of it afflicted him more than had he been depriv'd of all, by any other Accident. His Friends did all in their Power to asswage his Woes; and, as he had an extream good Character, and was really an honest Man, the Merchants of London acting like themselves, supported

his Credit abroad, advanc'd him Money, and set him so fairly in the World, that I left him greatly recover'd in his Spirits and Fortune.

'DEAR Sir, said Conyers, you give me great Joy, but I am curious to know, if possible, what became of Mrs. Smith.'— Her Fate, reply'd Pensé, was dreadful enough. Fanfaron, for some Time, liv'd a gay and splendid Life. Constancy and Humanity were not amongst his Virues or Vices; so that in about Twelve Months, Madam was sent to Graze on the Common, till at last, having run through every Scene of Misery, attended by a guilty Conscience, she finish'd her Days in the Hospital of La Charitè.'

TEARS stood in Conyers's Eyes; but when he a little recover'd, 'poor Wretch, said he, as the Hand of Providence is so visible, I shall not pretend to arraign its Justice or Mercy.—I presume, continued he, Monsieur Fanfaron enjoys the Remainder of her Fortune with vast Comfort and Satisfaction, and doubt not, but he will some Day or other, have the Honour of entertaining a Crowd at the Greve;'—'and very likely, added Pensé, attended by his Friend Maquereau.—This other fine Gentleman, continued he, was a

Footman in Paris, and went to London with an English Lord. Had he had common Honesty, he might have made a Fortune, for he don't want Sense. He pass'd through many Services, and was remarkably dextrous in the nice Conduct of an Affair, which in Italy is managed by a Secretario de Amore, and what in England is term'd Pimping. The Money he got by this Branch of Business, was all laid out at the Gaming-Table. However, I found him in Paris a few Years ago, with an Equipage; but by some Circumstances that then happen'd, I have Reason to believe his last Master was not the richer for him.—But let us drop these Fellows, for they are not worth our Thoughts, tho' we are compell'd sometimes to dine with, and be civil to them.'
'I OBSERV'D, said Conyers, an Englishman, at Table Yesterday with a young Lad, and what surpriz'd me was, they never open'd their Mouths, but to eat and drink.'—'O, reply'd Pensé with a Laugh, the Gentleman you mention, is a BEAR-LEADER.'—'A BEAR-LEADER, cry'd Conyers,! In the Name of Wonder, what Profession is that?' Why, Sir, answer'd Pensé, A Bear-leader is a Man

who understands Latin and Greek, and is well paid by a rich Father, to take his Child and expose him through every great Town in Europe.'—'I suppose, said Conyers, you mean a Governor to a young Gentleman in his Travels.'—'You may give it, reply'd the other, what Name you please in England, but I am sure they here give it the proper Appellation; for the Boys that generally follow these Leaders, may very justly be call'd Cubs.'— Conyers smil'd, and the Conversation continued on various Subjects till they withdrew to Dinner.'
IN the Evening, Jack gave Mr. Villeneuf some Account of his Visit, and did not forget the Description of a Bear-leader. —Certain it is, said Villeneuf, nothing improves the Mind of a young Man like prudent Travel. We are sensible of this in England, but few know how to conduct it.—We generally take a Lad from the University, where, tho' he has acquir'd some Learning, yet he is as ignorant of the World as his Bed-maker, and at once Case him up in fine Cloaths, and let him Run a Winter or two in London. He is then taken up and saddled with a Governor, who Races him round Europe, and in two or three Years he returns

to his dear Parents loaded with the Bawbles and Vices of each Country.'— And is this, Sir, said Conyers, the mighty Uses of Travelling?'—''Tis but too frequently so, reply'd Villeneuf, but when a Youth of Education, improved by good Company, travels with a Gentleman of Sense for his Companion, his Friends may expect the Harvest of a thorough Accomplishment. This Youth will remark on the Strength and Weakness of different Countries; on the Usefulness of different Manufactures, and endeavour to transplant those Sciences that may advantage his Country, and improve it. This I call travelling, and not riding Post; but to send a Boy of Sixteen or Seventeen Years of Age, who knows nothing of his own Country, with a Pedant as ignorant as himself, is truly, what your Friend calls exposing both to the Ridicule and Imposition of Foreigners, and brings a Contempt on our Country.—One will improve by the good Customs and Manners, and the other as certainly catch the Follies and Impertinences of every Nation they travel through; and every Nation have some of one, and too much of the other.


'SIR, said Conyers, tho' I do not pretend to be a Traveller, yet I cannot help

observing, that the Courtesy of this Country is not of the right Breed. Their Civilities, or, as they call it, their Politeness, seems to me rather an Habit, and Jingle of Words, than to carry a Meaning significant of what they express.'— Sometimes, said Villeneuf, it is so; yet, when I find myself deceived, their Manner of doing it, prevents my finding Fault, and even pleases. 'Tis this Sort of Manner that makes a Stranger pass his Time, more agreeably in France, than in most other Countries, and what I wish our People had a little more of.'—I believe, Sir, answered Conyers, if our English want that Manner, they make it fully up by their Sincerity.—So we say, reply'd Villeneuf, but suppose it Fact, What have I to do with the Sincerity of a People with whom I mean to pass but a short Time; to contract no particular Friendships; and to keep myself in that neutral civil Stile which every Man has a Title to? Believe me, Conyers, Men of Fortune will be naturally drawn to that Place where they can purchase most Pleasure, and receive most Honour. You may, if you please, call it Flattery; but since we choose to swallow, they are in the Right to administer the Dose.'—'I wonder, said

Conyers, that so much of it don't turn the Stomach.'—Just the contrary, reply'd Villeneuf, for the Stomach is so accustom'd to it, that it becomes a real Nutriment, and a Nutriment, that many Courts in Europe are so fond of, that they will purchase it, tho' their Liberties may be the Price.—I have often heard, said Conyers, that the French have always aimed at Universal Monarchy, but I should imagine, that the Fate of the Romans who fell by their own Weight, would deter them from such a Project; but Ambition and Glory have no Bounds.'— If, said Villeneuf, they have such Notions, they may manage in another Manner. By the Conversation I have frequently had with some Gentlemen of Understanding, I have laid down a Plan of French Politicks by Way of Hypothesis, and not as Truth, which is very difficult to come at. If my Conjectures are right, their System is short, and far from impracticable.—But it is now late, so take it, and examine it at your Leisure.'
WHEN both were retir'd, Conyers read, and copied, as he always did, the Observations of Mr. Villeneuf. He now began, from the Study of Books, to examine the Truth from the Study of Man, and compare

them together. — The Reflections of Mr. Villeneuf, and the Additions made by Conyers, according to the Time he had occasion to mention them, must be left to that Time to discover; for he is now going to Bed, and so am I.


CHAP. XVIII.


'Tis an Old Maxim in the Schools,
That Flatt'ry is the Food of Fools;
Yet now and then your Men of Wit
Will condescend to take a Bit.

SWIFT.



CONYERS constantly visited Monsieur Pensé and was much improv'd by his Company. Mr. Villeneuf was so extreamly pleas'd, that he supplied him very liberally with Money; but whatever good Sense Jack possessed, he by no Means understood the Uses of that Commodity. His Landlady and the fair Madelain were determined to enjoy an equal Share of it, at the small Expence of a little Flattery, and the nice tickling the String of Vanity and Self-Opinion, so common in Youth, and what

Age and Experience are not always Proof against.
THESE Ladies had engaged the Esteem of Conyers, by a thousand winning Ways; but now, his Person and his vast Accomplishments were the Theme of every Hour. When they spoke of him to Strangers, it was with Rapture, but they took Care that he was within hearing. This Sort of Conduct not only produced frequent Plays, Operas and Parties of Pleasure; but often extracted half a dozen Pieces for some pretended Emergency, which were repaid by Madelain in Caresses, and by every Freedom except the last.

THEY often wished that Conyers had a Fortune agreeable to his Merit, and insinuated, that perhaps they might be of Service to him. —'It is not, said Madame Commode, a New or Uncommon Thing for Ladies of Fortune to make themselves Happy with a young Gentleman of your Figure and Understanding.'—'And I know, said Madelain, a most beautiful Lady with half a Million of Livres; that, I believe, sees Monsieur Conyer oftener then he imagines.'—'In a Word, cry'd Madame, since my Girl has blabbed out so much, I must tell you a little more. The Daughter of a rich Banker of Paris,

has seen you, and is actually in Love. Her Companion sups with me this Evening, and you must be of the Party.'— Lord, Madame, cry'd Madelain, what a charming Couple they will be! how delightfully will they live!—What a superbe Equipage, and magnificent Hotel! Good God! What cannot Youth, Beauty, and Riches do together.'—'Hold, hold, said her Mother, not so fast if you please. Fair and softly:—This must be a Work of some Time, and managed with great Address, or we shall stumble on many Difficulties.'—Conyers blush'd, and gave many Thanks for the good Opinion she was pleased to entertain of him—that he would study to deserve her Favour, and would be entirely guided by her.—'Leave it to me, reply'd Madame, and I will engage to make something of it.—I need not desire you to be chearful and free with the Lady to Night, but don't think of making her any Presents till you become a little more intimate, which I hope will be about the third Visit.—Presents must be made, but let them be genteel and frequent.—They pave the Way, and oyl the Hinges,—You understand me.'— Extremely well, reply'd Conyers, and as

I know they are absolutely necessary they shall not be wanting.'
CONYERS provided some excellent Burgundy and Champaign, and in the Evening was presented, with great Form and Encomiums, to the amiable Companion of the Fair unknown. At Supper he was extremely Gay and polite, and, at her Request, sung several new Songs in an elegant Taste.— Mademoiselle FARDE was highly delighted with his agreeable Company, and gave many Proofs of it.—Madame Commode and Madelain were very lavish in their Praises, and the Night concluded with mutual Marks of Esteem and Respect.
A SECOND and a Third Evening past pretty much like the First, except that Mademoiselle Fardé and Conyers were very intimate and free; Madame Commode, by Accident shewing some fine new fashioned Caps and Ruffles, Conyers embraced the luckly Opportunity of presenting Mademoiselle Fardé with what she seemed to like most. The Gift was a Trifle of about Twelve Lewis d'Or's; and, with great Entreaty, was accepted. That Night the good Lady of the House brought on the proper Subject, and with some Hesitation Mademoiselle Fardé acknowledged that Monsieur Conyer was not indifferent to the Lady

she had the Honour to live with.—Conyers bow'd and assured her he was in Love with the Description of that beautiful Angel, and with many Apologies, begged she would convey a small Billet to her fair Hands. Mademoiselle Fardé objected to such a Proceedure, and would have absolutely refused it, had not Madame Commode and Madelain most artfully pleaded his Cause.—He had a Letter prepared, which he most respectively gave her.—She was equally ready, and, with a wink, slipped a Note into his Hand.
WHEN all were retired he read his Billet which contained these Words, I have my Reasons. Let me see you To-morrow Evening at Six o'Clock in the Tuilleries. Keep this a profound Secret. Adieu.—Conyers was punctual, and Fardé was exact.— She told him, 'twas impossible to meet so often at Madame Commode's without being observed, and to take him to the Lady's House was impossible; that to be of Service to both, she had taken a private Lodging, where they could settle Matters, and where the Lady would certainly meet him, were it in her Power. She then added, We may be observed even here, let us retire. — Conyers attended, and was conducted to a little Lane, and a very indifferent Chamber of which she had the

Key.—Here she informed him of many Particulars with Regard to the young Lady, and gave him Hopes of bringing Matters to bear, and promised her utmost Assistance. — So much Goodness naturally claimed a grateful Return, and at last she was prevailed on to accept Ten Pieces. His Generosity charmed her, nor could she forbear answering his tender Embraces, which by Degrees became more Fervent, so that —you will permit a Continuance of this History.

HE had now compleatly fixed Mademoiselle Fardé on his Side, yet they met at his Lodgings as usual, but more frequently in this.—The young Lady answered his Billets in a proper and polite Manner, and permitted him to Hope. He reply'd as politely, and the Correspondence went on in the most agreeable Manner, though he sometimes thought that the Postage was rather too expensive; however, as he was sure of the Lady's Affections, he judged it well bestowed, and waited for the Issue with great Patience for above Four Months.
ONE Morning as he was going out, he found a Letter to Madame Commode, which had been dropt by Accident, and he read,




Dear Commode,

YOU have afforded me infinite Pleasure by the Company of the English Man. Were he richer, our Profit would be greater; however, I shall do my Part to ease the poor Devil of what he don't know the Value of. I send you back the embroidered Petticoat, which the Fool gave me last Night, so give the Bearer Six Lewis d'Or's. I shall call on you To-morrow, and think I have a Scheme to keep the silly Fellow's Hopes alive, at least three Months longer. Adieu.

FARDE.




No London Citizen look'd so much Aghast,

At the dread Shock of first or second Earthquake;

Nor Broughton, famous Bruiser! felt such Pangs
When Slack, the Pupil of his Iron Hands,
Rais'd his tough Fists, and with a mighty Stroke
Bury'd those Eyes that saw to aim so well;
As look'd and felt, the Poor, the bubbl'd Conyers.




He stared and read, but at last cry'd out, I am an English Man—I am a poor Devil, a Fool, and silly Fellow, but— Art to Art,'—and then he left the Letter just where he found it.

HE recover'd his usual Sprightliness, and went to find Mr. Pensé, to whom he communicated the Beginning of this Affair in a very serious Manner; but Pensé had no sooner heard Madame Commode named, than he bid him, have a Care.—'I am surprized, said he, that a young Fellow of your Understanding, has not found out that that Lady is but of the middling Order of Bawds.—You are her Dupe, her Cully, and give me but Permission, and I shall demonstrate it to you.'— Permit me, said Conyers, to thank and save you the Trouble, for I know it perfectly well, but my Knowledge is not Three Hours old.'—He then told him the Remainder of the Story, and begged his Advice, which Pensé gave, with an Addition of good Instructions.
CONYERS found Means to persuade Villeneuf to change Lodgings, and on various Pretences to borrow a few Louis from Madame Commode, and even from Mademoiselle Fardé.—At last he contrived a Letter as from London to a Merchant in Paris,

wherein, among many Particulars, he expressed his Surprise, that Mr. Conyers would choose to live in the Manner he did with Mr. Villeneuf, when a large Estate waited his Orders, by the Death of his Father. A Gentleman delivered to Mrs. Commode this Letter open with Directions where he lived, but that he would have the Honour of waiting on Mr. Conyers, in a few Days.
'TIS not easy to conceive the Impression this Letter made on the Mother and Daughter. They gave it to Conyers with prodigious Respect, and formed Projects infinitely more extensive than the first.—He told them he knew of this before, therefore was not elate on any Advancement of Fortune; but he likewise found a Time to persuade Madelain to accompany him to England, and share it with him.—As she consented to his generous Proposal, it is not surprising that they sealed the Agreement in the most solemn Manner.

HE was now out of the House of Madame Commode, and constantly visited Mademoiselle Fardé. This good Creature was much more liberal of her Favours than he expected; but Jack being of a free communicative Temper, Miss Madelain shared in her Bounty. He soon was sensible of his

Situation, and applyed to his Friend Pensé, who, with a Smile, said, This Affair has ended with strict poetical Justice, and let it there remain. Drop these fine Ladies, and make your Court to a Surgeon.


POOR Conyers was greatly mortified.— The Reflections of his Mind were not lightened by the Pains of his Body. He found he had not only acted imprudently, but wickedly; and, once more, began to repent, that is, to dread a sharper Punishment; for he had that Sort of uneasy Fore-boding in the Soul, that many feel, but what none can describe or account for.
HIS Intimacy with Pensé, for almost two Years, had grown into a strict Friendship. —To this sensible Man, he discovered his present Situation, and almost his whole Life, and received such Consolation and Comfort, that greatly alleviated his Sorrow. —They were now in the Tuilleries, and the Surprise of Conyers was extream, when Mr. Pensé began to speak in very good English. —'Tis but just, my dear Conyers, said he, to repay your Confidence in me, by giving you some Account of myself, which I shall fairly do, and in few Words.


I WAS born, continued he, in London, of French Protestant Parents, and my real Name is Villars. My Father was a Mercer,

and bred me to the Business; but it seems, my idle Inclinations led me more to Plays, Gaming-Houses, and Horse Races. —My Father thought, that a prudent Wife would take off my Wildness, and provided me with as good a one as ever Man was blessed with.—We commenced in Trade, and had tolerable Business; but Diversion, or what they call innocent Recreation, was strong in my weak Head. I was often at the Play-Houses, and a constant Member of two or three notable Clubs.—I sometimes tryed my Fortune at a Masquerade, where my Disguise saved my Reputation, but not my Purse.— I kept a Brace of good Geldings, and frequently ventured Fifty or an Hundred Pieces at Epsom, Tunbridge, and other Races.—My poor dear Girl, with gentle Words, and Tears in her Eyes, has remonstrated the Injury I did my Credit;— That I lost not only my Money to Sharpers, but my Youth and Time, which never could be recall'd.—I laugh'd at her sober Follies, but she never replyed, but, —Well, well, I hope my dear Tom will think before it is too late.


NOTWITHSTANDING my idle Extravagancies, my dear Wife managed the Shop so well, that my Circumstances rather increased

than diminished.—The Folly of appearing rich in the Eyes of the World, is a sure Way of being poor in Reality.— This Folly I had, and without considering my Force, I took a House and Garden at Dulwich, kept my Chair and more Servants; and, according to Custom, went there on Saturdays, and returned on Mondays; but to my Shame I speak it, I did worse, much worse, for I kept a Whore.—Oh, Mr. Conyers! could my Example, could the Compunction of Mind I now feel be a Warning to Mankind, I should have some Pleasure in being a Sacrifice for their Use!—Well, Sir, these Matters took their natural Course. I began to think People asked for their Money more frequently than they were wont.—I was pestered with Duns.—I practised all the low Arts, and Contrivances to silence their Importunities.—My Plate and Silks often visited the Pawnbrokers, and sometimes I was privately arrested.—My Mind was on the Rack. I suffered the Torments of the damn'd; and all this, for Follies and Imprudencies, that, in the highest Enjoyment, afforded but an insipid Pleasure.—Good God! what exquisite Misery! Though my Temper was soured, my dearest Girl bore my Peevishness

with a peculiar Sweetness of Manners. —So far from reproaching my Conduct, she had laid down a rational Plan for retrieving all.—No doubt her Trouble was great, but it was internal, and her delicate, tender Nature sunk under the Weight, and she—died in my Arms!— Oh Conyers!
—Poor Pensé could utter no more, for his Heart swell'd, and the round Drops chac'd one another down his manly Cheeks.—Conyers was much in the same Situation, but at last he said from Shakespear,

'Thy Heart is big, get thee apart and weep:
'Passion I see is catching; for my Eyes,
'Seeing those Beads of Sorrow stand in thine,
'Begin to water.'


They took two or three silent Turns in the Walks, and in about a Quarter of an Hour Pensé had so much recovered as to be able to proceed.

To the Loss of my Wife was added the Infidelity of my Servants, which my Carelesness made an easy Matter.—Finding the Impossibility of re-establishing my Credit, I secreted to the Value of Five Hundred

Pounds, and leaving my Shop and Effects to the Mercy of my Creditors, took Shelter in Paris.—I had but one Comfort in all my Misfortunes, for I had no Child to share the Afflictions of a guilty Father.



IN this City I have chiefly resided for Fifteen Years, and get a seeming Livelihood by lending Money on Pledges, but the British Minister is my principal Support. He has employed me on many Occasions, and to give him Intelligence of every Occurrence these Ten Years past. Four Years ago I went to London on his Affairs, where I met those two worthy Gentlemen, Fanfaron and Maquereau. — The French look on me as one of themselves.—I live quietly, and as a Gentleman, and believe I am not suspected. — Conyers return'd him many Thanks for his candid Relation, and assured him of his inviolable 'Secrecy.

THEY were now talking of indifferent Matters, when Pensé turn'd suddenly and said, Pray what is the Motto to the Order of the Bath?
—Conyers, though surpriz'd at the Question, answer'd, 'TRIA JUNCTA IN UNO.'—'Then, reply'd Pensé, observe those three Gentlemen by yonder Tree in such earnest Conversation,

and then you will see the Motto in Reality.—One, continued he, is an English Non-Juring Parson; the other is a Irish Man of the Society of Jesus, and the Third is a Scotch Man of the Episcopal Church.— Those three, and many others of the same Stamp, have Pensions here, and at different Times reside in London, and divert themselves, and frighten the credulous People by numberless Pamphlets and Paragraphs in News-Papers, full of the Decay of Trade.—The Weakness and Wickedness of the Ministry, be they whom it will. —The Danger of our Liberties by Pribery and Corruption.—The dreadful Consequences of a Standing Army, and many other popular Subjects.—The Scotch Man is a Master of his Trade, and keeps up the Credit of his Books by, very ingeniously, answering them himself, which furnishes him an Opportunity of replying to himself.—They really are Men of Learning and strong Parts, and meet with great Encouragement from the Enemies of England.'


I SHALL not, said Conyers, interrupt their pious Meditations, for I am call'd to Mr. Villeneuf, who, I fear, waits, for my Appetite informs me it is near Dinner-time.

—Few Ceremonies suffice amongst Friends, and they parted, but promis'd to meet soon again.


CHAP. XIX.


If Dame Partial'ty but holds the Glass,
Full sure, in ev'ry Virtue we surpass.
Change but the Mirror, and let Prudence speak,
We'll blush at Error, and our fond Mistake.

ANONIMOUS.



FOR some Time past, Mr. Villeneuf had frequently made Conyers of his Party, and was not disgrac'd by his Behaviour. This Day a select Company din'd at an eminent Citizen's.—Chearfulness and good Humour added the true Relish to the Entertainment; but when the Servants were withdrawn, the Conversation fell on particular Subjects.—As no Man, said Monsieur St. Martin, can judge so impartially of his own Country as a Stranger of Understanding, I should be glad Mr. Villeneuf would give us his Opinion of France, with Freedom, and his accustom'd Sincerity.—Many Apologies were made, and Compliments returned, till at last Mr. Villeneuf consented, provided that the Question

was fairly stated.—'I cannot suppose, said he, you mean to have my Opinion on what regards State Affairs.'—'No, no, reply'd the other, we only beg your Thoughts of the People, their Politeness, their Manners, their Dress and their Happiness, or otherwise.'—''Tis a difficult Task you have assigned me, said Villeneuf, and will require your Patience: But as great and little—long and short—strong and weak, are made such, only by Comparison, I hope you will permit an alternate Account of England, under the several Articles.' —The Company approv'd of his Method, and he began.

FEW People on Earth are blessed with such a Fund of Spirits and natural Gaiety of Temper as the French; and yet few Nations are more crampt in the natural Exercise of it. They laugh, they sing, they dance, and seem content. The Publick are constantly supplyed with Amusements, and Policy has so contrived, as to make Glory and War be thought a rational Recreation. All are disregarded but those who serve the King in his Troops; his Majesty's Name is never mentioned, but with the profoundest Respect. We never see his Portrait hung out as a Sign, in Paris, because it would be treating

the Monarch with too much Freedom, but the Sign of the Holy-Ghost, and all the Saints are dispersed through every Street. A King is always the Head of the most childish Games, and at Cards, the Best, is honoured with that Title.— Such Principles are propagated with great Art, and the Religion of the Country admitting Auricular Confession and Absolution, an Absolute Monarch can, with Ease, direct the Current of Opinion.—Men of Learning and Judgment must go with the Stream, for it falls from too high a Fountain to be resisted, whatever their private Sentiments may be. Besides, Two or Three Hundred Thousand Orators well armed, will always carry Demonstration and Conviction. In England, where the Constitution admits the full Enjoyment of Property, and where Property is proportionably divided amongst all the Inhabitants, one would imagine they should be more chearful than the French, but the Fact is otherwise; for this very Property, and the Liberty of employing it, has the contrary Effect. They have the Blessing, but a Jealousy, and the perpetual Dread of losing it, throws Thorns on their Pillows, and, like the Miser, they starve in the midst of

Plenty. They employ Watchmen for their Security, yet are in constant Fear of being plundered by them.—This is the Rise of all the Clamour against an Handful of Troops.—The Religion of England teaches Duty and Submission to the King, and those in Authority under him, but some imagine, that the Liberty of England gives the People a Right to abuse all; not considering, that by lessening and ridiculing the just Power and Authority of their Governors, they lessen their own Weight and Consequence in the World.
FRANCE has propagated the Notion of Military Honour to such a Degree, that they are become a Nation of JANISARIES, and perhaps must be treated as such,—that is, they must, Right or Wrong, be frequently employed. Commerce and Traffick flourish in Peace.— Riches and Plenty, Learning and Knowledge are the Consequences, as well as Pride and Luxury. Men naturally become fond of these Sweets, and will not quietly forego them. They will find out their own Strength and Power. They will expect a Freedom of Action, as well as Thought, and absolute Monarchy will fall before them.—RICHELIEU knew this.—

He broke and divided the Power of the Nobility, not like Henry the Seventh of England, amongst the People, but added all to the Dignity and Power of the Crown.—MAZARIN did the same, and LOUVOIS, FOUQUET and COLBERT compleated the Project, and the long Reign and Ambition of LEWIS confirmed it. The King of GREAT-BRITAIN is the Fountain of Honour; but the Monarch of this Kingdom is not only the Fountain of real, but the Creator of imaginary Honours. A trivial Cross dangling at a Button-hole, gives a French Gentleman such a Spirit of Honour, as to intreat a General to permit him to mount a Breach. In England, it must be a valuable Consideration that can persuade most Men even to do their Duty.
THE Fashions of the two Nations are on different Footings. Here, in whatever Manner the King or those about him are pleased to wear their Swords, or dress their Hair, it instantly becomes the Practice of all Paris. Every Man from the Duke, to the Porter, has his Hat cocked and his Coat cut nearly in the same Manner. London affords more Variety.—There every Man dresses according to his Fancy. Some have Coats below

the Knees, and Breeches down to the Middle of the Leg. Others mount their Breeches to the Thighs, and raise their Skirts to their Waists. Some Shopkeepers dress like Privy Counsellors, and some of high Rank may be mistaken for Coach-men.—I am ignorant who had the Honour of inventing Weepers, when in Mourning, but I think I may venture to affirm our Manner of wearing them answers the End of Ornament, and keeps the Shirt from being blacken'd by the Coat. To wear them on the Top of the Sleeve, can answer no End.
THE English Ladies rely on their native Charms, nor want the Assistance of Paint to heighten their Complexions. Whether the French Ladies really stand in Need of Art, I know not, but their Conduct seems to imply it.—Whatever good Sense the French are Masters of, this is certainly not the most glaring Instance.
IN France, Politeness is not always good Manners, neither is the Bluntness of an Englishman always a Mark of Sincerity. The Lye is more frequently given in France, than is generally imagin'd, but the Pardon that is begg'd, and the Excuse that is demanded, (Je demand Excuse; Pardonne moi) softens the Negative, which,

with the Addition of sundry significant Gestures, Custom has made That genteel, which frequently is the Reverse.—In England, these Customs are accounted superfluous, and they deny or contradict in plain Terms, even without the Assistance of the rude Monosyllable.
I HAVE been often told, "I must own." (Il faut avouer) 'I confess I do not understand the Phrase.—If I must believe, I am depriv'd of the Liberty of thinking for myself, and my Arguments must cease, when I am pinn'd down to the Reasons of my Antagonist. In England, the Freedom of judging is held more sacred.
THE Theatres of the two Nations were different. The Tragedies and Plays of the English Shakespear gave Rise to those of France. His Imagination was not confin'd by the Rules of Aristotle, as, perhaps, he thought he had as good a Right to Alter, as the other had to Make. If the English, by following new Models, are more regular in Unity, Time and Place, I am sorry to say, their Fire is not so bright, nor will their Heat last so long. —Monsieur de Voltaire and l'Abbé le Blanc take great Pains to shew the Absurdity of some of our Authors, in transporting

the Audience to different Kingdoms, and continuing the Scenes of one Play for many Years, but they do not tell us, that in Tragedy or Comedy, where we are to suppose an easy, natural Conversation, it is unnatural to make the Parties speak in Rhyme. They insist, that the Action should be confin'd to twenty-four Hours; if so, I apprehend it is unnatural to have it represented in three. If twenty-four Hours Business can be shewn in so short a Time, we may as well have twenty-four Years.—The Abbé complains of our murdering on the Stage, and says, that a Man, not understanding our Language, must take us for a barbarous People, delighting in Blood. Should a Man, not understanding French, see the Stage in Tears, and in the utmost Agony of Grief, must he not wonder what has occasioned it? The Truth is, neither of the Stages are made for those who do not understand the Language, but I really think every Stranger, or Frenchman of Sense, must be shock'd at the unnatural absurd Entertainment of a Speaking Harlequin with a patch'd Coat, and a black Face.

THE English are full loose in their Morals, but I really think, Libertinism reigns

here in a much higher Degree. The French have a Way of varnishing their Vices, and making them more dangerous and catching than our aukward Manner can arrive at.—When an Englishman swears by his Maker, it is shocking, but when the French, with Eyes and Hands lifted up, cry out, Sacred God! (Sacré Dieu!) it is little regarded, as it is the common Expression of every Ten Minutes. The French have another Phrase, which is but too commonly us'd, even before Ladies, and what some Ladies are as familiar with. This Phrase serves to shew Pleasure or Anger, according to the Tone or Manner of speaking.—How often are the Words, Fou-re, Fou-u, Bou-re, Bou-sse, pronounc'd in the politest Assemblies, and pass'd over as if no Idea was annex'd to them?—I am ignorant of any Rules that establish such Indecencies, except the strong Law of a bad Custom. I am much pleas'd that Voltaire, and le Blanc, could not mark these amongst our other Follies; but they totally forget them when they mention their own. The Abbé very justly censures the Looseness and Ribaldry of some of our Comedies, but he omits to inform us, that no Nation excels

France in the Multitude of abomiable and filthy Books.

INFORMERS against the Breach of the Laws, are absolutely necessary in every civiliz'd Government. The Informer, when his Motive springs from Conscience, and the Good of his Country, is a most valuable Subject, and merits the Regard of Mankind. But to be inform'd against, and hurried to the Bastile, or banish'd in an Instant by a Letter de Cachet, without knowing the Accuser or the Crime, may, for aught I know, be very good Policy, but I am sure it is not Justice.—In England, let the Motives of Information be what they will, the Informer is, not only, not skreen'd and shelter'd from his Enemies, but is given up to the Reproach and Invectives of an engrag'd Populace. Laws are made, and Punishments assign'd for Transgressors, but our Vox Populi decrees a severer Treatment to the Discoverer, and saps the very Foundation of Laws.
WITH regard to the Happiness of the French or English, no Mortal can judge. It must be left to their own Decision; that is, each will give the Preference to themselves, for each have that natural Prejudice and Partiality to their own

Country, that persuades them into an Opinion of their peculiar Felicity.—Did not Mankind deceive themselves, by imagining an ideal Happiness, they would be miserable in Reality.—Deform'd Persons have generally a large Share of Vanity and Self-Opinion. They are infinitely happy, when their Mirror discovers Beauty and Charms which the World do not find out. Such a Conduct is justify'd by the wise Scheme of Providence, as it gives Ease and Comfort to their Lives, which otherwise would be almost insupportable. —Perhaps the same Argument may be apply'd to Kingdoms.

Thus, Gentlemen, I have given short Hints of my private Opinion, taking Things in a general Light, but I know there are many Exceptions.—The Wise, the Good, the Honest of both Nations, have equal Sentiments, and speak one common Language.—Both Nations have their peculiar Virtues as well as Vices.— In a Word, if the People of one were less a Dupe to Glory and arbitrary Power, and the other less a Prey to extravagant Liberty, I apprehend, both would have more Content.—But to be perfectly happy, is not given to human Nature.


THE Company express'd much Satisfaction at Mr. Villeneuf's Discourse, particularly at the Manner he conducted it.—At last one of the Gentlemen said, I know England, and some of their Laws. I know the Nature of their Parliament, and the Power of the Crown. I know the vast Benefit of their Juries, and the good Effects of their Habeas Corpus Act. My Knowledge but increases my Astonishment, that a People, enjoying a Liberty and Freedom unknown to all other Nations on Earth, should repine at their Situation, and take Pains to imbitter the blessed Waters of Peace and Plenty. Since all Things, as you say, rise or fall by Comparison, what Happiness would the English enjoy, did they but turn their Eyes on the Miseries of other Kingdoms?' As Frenchmen, reply'd another, we ought not to be angry at their Conduct; for, were they truly sensible of their Happiness, and all united to their real Interest, what Power could stand before them? No doubt, our Ministry know this too well, to neglect any Opportunity of dividing them, nor is it a difficult Task; for the Liberty of the Country, and the unbounded Licence of the Press, easily furnishes Tools to work with.'—'I am

afraid, Sir, said Villeneuf, your Conjecture, is but too well founded, yet I must hope, Time will open our Eyes, not by supressing the Press, but by despising the Invectives, the Slander, and the vile Insinuations it too frequently throws out.

THE Conversation insensibly became more general, and their different Opinions were given with Freedom and good Humour. Conyers had his Share, and made himself very agreeable by sprightly and chearful Turns.—Come, come, said Monsieur St. Martin, talk as you will, I think it is given up, that we live with Gaiety, Mirth and Chearfulness, and that is Living. The Want of this, I believe, is the Reason that SUICIDE and MADNESS are much more common in England than in France.'—'Pray, Sir, said Conyers, let me be permitted to take off a little of the Imputation, and account for the seeming Difference from other Reasons, than what Monsieur le Blanc, and other French Authors have given.


MANKIND, continued Conyers, are pretty much the same in every Clime. Our frantick Disorders are conspicuous to the World.—If France be equally liable to them, the Nature of their Government casts a Veil over the Misfortune.—With

us, if a poor Wretch hangs or drowns himself, the News-writers immediately give the Circumstances and his Name to the whole Kingdom.—Such an Affair in Paris is seldom known beyond the District he liv'd in.—As to Madness, we cannot insist on a Parity in Numbers.— We have publick and private Mad-houses in Abundance, and many unhappy Creatures are expos'd to publick View.— Perhaps France has less Need of these Edifices, when 'tis consider'd they have, at least, an hundred Thousand of both Sexes in Monasteries and Convents.—As these Seminaries take in the several Degrees from the most Austere to a Life of easy Inaction, may we not naturally suppose, that Numbers of the Inhabitants take Shelter into those ORDERS, that have the nearest Affinity to the Degree of Enthusiasm and Madness with which they are possess'd?—Of this, the many thousand Volumes of Lives of Saints, many of whom never existed, but in the Brains of Monks, is a convincing Proof.—If we meet Numbers in different Habits walking the Streets, and seemingly exercising the Function of right Reason and Understanding, who can count those confined to their Cells, or to the Limits of their Garden? I am not

singular in my Conjecture, for the famous Monsieur d' Aubigny, about the Year 1600, writes this Epigram.




HUGUENOTS, fascheux &amp; Austeres,


Qui blamez tant les Monasteres,

A la Pareille, dites nous


Où l'en pourroit loger les Fous?


Ill-natur'd CALVINISTS, who scold
At MONASTERIES, and what they hold;
Without their Aid, pray tell us plain,
Where could we all the MAD maintain?


THE Epigram furnish'd the Company with a good deal of laughing Chat, though they did not deny but there was some Truth in the Question.—Time puts an End to all Things, as it did to this Conversation. —The usual Compliments and Bows being made on all Sides, each separated to their Places of Repose, which affords me and my Reader an Opportunity of doing the like.



CHAP. XX.


What God, alas! will Caution be
For living Man's Security,
Or will insure his Vessel in this faithless Sea?
Where Fortune's Favours, and her Spight,
Roll with alternate Waves, like Day and Night.

COWLEY.



NEXT Morning Mr. Villeneuf found himself much out of Order, yet he could not avoid mentioning what, with Design, he had omitted in the Conversation of Yesterday.—God forbid, said he, that persecuting Spirit should ever prevail in England, yet I should imagine, Self-preservation ought at least to keep us upon our Guard against the Encroachments of POPERY; for, though we are not their Enemies, because they are Papists, yet they are certainly our's, because we are Protestants.—We suffer them in England to purchase Estates; and the Influence Property carries with it, is sometimes too visible.—They are likewise permitted to sell their Estates, but the Hugonots in

France may purchase, but cannot sell.— We allow our Subjects to attend the Romish Chapels of Foreign Ministers, but what Frenchman dare visit our Ambassador's Chapel at Paris?—Without forcing the Consciences of Men, I think we might, and ought to take some Example from our Neighbours.—Sending Protestant Youths of both Sexes, to be educated in the Colleges of Jesuits, or in the Convents of Nuns, is such a monstrous, such an absurd Practice, that, as no Name can be given, so no Punishment can be equal to the Crime.


THIS, Sir, reply'd Conyers, has often surprised me, but there is another Matter, equally astonishing.—I know what was formerly understood by a Nonjuror. I know that a scrupulous Conscience might refuse the Oaths to King WILLIAM, when he had before taken them to King JAMES, but I cannot conceive what a Nonjuror is in these Days.'—'And you will, said Villeneuf, be more amazed, when I tell you, he is one of those rank Weeds that the best Land is most subject to. A Nonjuror is a Person that avails himself of that Liberty, and Constitution of England, which his Principles, and the Study of his whole Life, labours to destroy.—He denies

the Validity of the Foundation of our Laws.—He calls himself a Protestant, and yet acts on Popish Tenets.—How it is possible, such a Being can be suffer'd in our State, is past my Comprehension. —If he refuses the Oath of Allegiance, which I wish was more frequently tender'd, what Security has the Government for his Conduct? And ought he not to be expell'd a Society, to which he avows himself an Enemy?—If he must be Resident, why is he not serv'd like the Jews in Germany, and oblig'd to wear a Badge of Distinction.

ON this Subject Mr. Villeneuf gave many Hints, but Conyers prevented his enlarging too much; and, as he saw his Countenance frequently change, he persuaded him to lie down.—All the Morning he complained of a violent Head-Ach, and Pain in the Back. —All Precautions were taken, and the best Physicians employ'd, but all prov'd ineffectual, for this good, this valuable young Gentleman died the fourteenth Day.
POOR Conyers was in the utmost Affliction, for he lost his Brother, his Friend, his Master, and his whole Support.—For some Time he was not able to attend his own Interest; but the good Nature of Mr. Pensé shar'd his Sorrows, and directed his Conduct.

—By the Will of Mr. Villeneuf, he found himself possess'd of Sixty Pounds, with all the Books and wearing Apparel he had in France. Pensé advis'd the selling the Books and all the Cloaths, except the Shirts; which done, he had about One Hundred and Fifty Pounds to begin a new Life. —Pensé knew perfectly his Situation, and many Projects were thought on to put this Sum to a proper Use; but, as neither of them could contrive how he might live on it, they pass'd them over without fixing, but Pensé promis'd to think for him.
WHILST their Imaginations were busily employ'd in forming Plans for his future Conduct, an Accident happen'd which I am almost asham'd to mention. I once intended to have suppress'd this Accident, but my strict Adherence to Truth, obliges me, though with Reluctance, to make it a Part of this History. Besides, as all the Memoirs and Papers that serv'd in compiling this great Work, are now deposited in the Cotton Library, for the Perusal of the Curious, and to vouch the Authenticity and Impartiality of this Performance, with what Face could I omit or gloss over a material Circumstance, and make my Veracity doubtful to the Publick. If some have taken

a contrary Method, I am determin'd to keep mine Integrity.

CONYERS did not always dine at the same Hotel, for different Companies afforded him different Remarks. At one of these Ordinaries, he had made a Sort of Acquaintance with a genteel young Man, of about his own Age, without inquiring into his Character. The Conversation happen'd to turn on the Folly and Absurdity of Gaming, and this Gentleman laid open the Subject and the Schemes of Sharpers, in so clear and convincing a Manner, that charm'd Conyers.—After Dinner, they took a Walk together, and renewed the Subject.—'Few Men, said the Stranger, understand Play better than I. Formerly I was a Bubble to it, but when I became a Master, and might have won back the Money I had lost, though I don't much want it, my Friends and Relations got round me, and oblig'd me to renounce Gaming for myself. I now assist some Friends, and but last Night I won two hundred Pieces for the Gentleman in Blue, with Gold Brandenburghs, that din'd with us. This I frequently do, and am of Use to some honest Fellows.'—'I should imagine, said Conyers, that a Man who constantly plays, must sometimes be liable to Quarrels, Disputes, and many other

Difficulties.'—'I grant you, reply'd the Gentleman, such Affairs happen in poor low Company, but the Assemblies I frequent, are composed but of People of Rank and Fortune. Most of them incog. so no one takes Notice, or seems to know another, but all are on the same Footing.'
OUR Hero listen'd with great Attention, and, by his many Questions, seem'd desirous to venture a small Matter, which perchance might double his Fund. The two hundred Pieces won last Night, ran strangely in his Head, and his Imagination put him already in Possession of such a Sum. Like a Fish, he went round and round, and often nibled at the Bait, till at length his eager Desires surmounted his Fears, and he swallow'd the Hook.

WHEN Conyers propos'd visiting the Temple of Fortune, the other made some few Difficulties, but was at last prevail'd on to lend him his Skill. In Pursuance to the Plan of Operation, Conyers gave him Forty Louis, and put Twenty more into his own Pocket. It was too soon to begin the Project; and, to divert the Time and raise their Spirits, the Gentleman proposed a Bottle of Champaign. They finish'd two, and Conyers found himself extremely elate,

and prognosticated vast good Fortune. He was like Alnaschar the famous Glass Man, for he had rais'd his Thoughts, and built the Edifice of Grandeur, but others had the Honour of kicking it all down.
THEY arriv'd at the Temple, where the Priests were assembled, and very earnest at their Devotions.—Conyers was fix'd at a Table with good Company, where he won and lost, but much wonder'd his Friend did not appear and assist him. He grew a little uneasy, but when he enquir'd, the Gentleman was not to be found, neither did any one know his Name. Conyers was unwilling to suspect him, and pursu'd his Fortune singly.—As no Man knows his own Courage till he is try'd, so Conyers knew not his Passion for Play, until he was at a Gaming Table.—His twenty Pieces being near expir'd, he ventur'd to ask, If any Gentleman would give him Credit till next Morning, in case he lost. With great Politeness they all agreed, there was no Difficulty in confiding in a Gentleman of his Appearance.

THE Play continued, and the Dice flew about with the usual Vehemence.—The fickle Goddess held the changing Balance, and joy'd to see such true, such fervent Zeal in all her Votaries.—The Rites and Ceremonies being finish'd, Conyers began to

examine the Mythology. He now discover'd that the Doctrine was extremely erroneous, for he had not only lost all his ready Money, but was indebted above Fifty Louis d'Ors.—The small Remains of the Night was not employ'd in the most agreeable Reflections, neither was the Morning usher'd in with happier Thoughts, for the Crime of last Night star'd him full in the Face, in the Shape of three Gentlemen with Demands of Money. Whilst employ'd in discharging these Debts of Honour, Mr. Pensé enter'd, which put him in the utmost Confusion. Pensé began to imagine that his Friend had taken up the Business of lending Money on Pledges, but a little of their Conversation soon convinc'd him of his Error.
WHEN the three Gentlemen had retir'd, our Friends stood silent, and gaz'd on each other for some Time.—Well Sir, said Pensé, I find the Prudent, the Wise, the Sagacious Mr. Conyers is beholden to Sharpers for making his Fortune, and giving him Experience.—Conyers blush'd, and, with some Hesitation, told his melancholy Tale; but concluded, with heartily cursing the Falshood of the French.—Very fine, cry'd Pensé, very fine, indeed. You have been bubbled by Pickpockets, and you

damn a whole Nation; but the Truth is, you ought to quarrel with your own Folly and Imprudence, and I hope you will so effectually do it, as for ever to banish them your Company.—Gaming, continued Pensé, is the most ruinous of all Vices. It is—

AS an Historian, I must be extremely angry with one HENRY FIELDING, who has wrote the Memoirs of a profligate Fellow, whom he calls TOM JONES.—This Man has done me great Injury, and I am apt to believe has seen the Materials of this History; for in one of his Volumes, he has not only copy'd the very long Discourse Mr. Pensé made on Gaming, but has rak'd together all that the Wisest have said, or could say on that Subject; so that he has very unfairly depriv'd me of the Benefit of a Dozen or Twenty Pages, which I must strike out, or be thought a Plagiary.— This is not the only Place where the said FIELDING has curtail'd my Reputation and crampt my Genius.—Without saying more on this barbarous and ungentleman-like Usage, I must insist, that the good natur'd Public will believe, I should have had more Reflections, and have been as fertile in Wit and Humour as the said Fielding, had he not

cruelly and enviously forestall'd my Invention.
CONYERS was all Attention to Mr. Pense's Harangue, and most faithfully promis'd to shun Temptation and avaricious Thoughts. —The Mischief is done, said Pense, so I shall upbraid no more. I had a Scheme for your Service, but doubt your consenting to it. I shall not flatter you, for, Why should the Poor be flatter'd? But what I have to say is my sincere Opinion. —You are, continued he, a very handsome genteel young Fellow, you have Learning and Understanding. You have cultivated your Talents by the Additions of polite Accomplishments; and the Excellency of your Voice, and your good Nature, make you belov'd by all. My dear Conyers, it is no Crime to be conscious of our Perfections, the Folly lies in being vain of, or over-rating them.— With your Endowments, and a prudent Management, you may make your Fortune, and be happy.—A Man must stoop, before we can justly say, he rises. In a Word, I wish you would act the Part of a Servant.—You will be maintain'd and cloath'd. By your Address, I know you will acquire Esteem; and, as there are Secrets in all Families, no doubt but

some may pass through your Hands. Out of these, and sundry Accidents that unavoidably happen, you may scheme some civil Employ, and establish yourself in the World, as many worthy Men have done, not bless'd with half your Capacity.'—Jack listen'd, but made no Reply. —'There is, said Pensé, another Argument in Favour of my Project, and a strong one, for I do not see what else you can do.—This last Reason got the Better of Pride, and Conyers consented.

NOW, said his Friend, to convince you I have had you in my Thoughts, I can promise you a Service with an English Lord, now returning to London; he is rich, extremely good humour'd, but not the brightest Genius in the World.—He keeps an English Wench.—I need not desire you to endeavour to have her Favour.

AT Dinner they met again, when Pensé inform'd him that my Lord Weakhead with Pleasure consented, as he wanted one to take Care of his Wardrobe, and write his Letters. —I would not, continued he, have you always fix'd to a particular Service or Family; for, except your Judgment shews you a Probability of succeeding in your chief Design, shift about, and try another Soil; but be sure to take Care of the

little Money you have left, lest you should be too long unemploy'd.

NEXT Morning they waited on Lord Weakhead, who would not agree, until his Dulcinea had approved. In some Time the Lady made her Appearance, and was so good to say, 
she believ'd the Fellow would do well enough. His Lordship told Conyers the Duty he expected from him, and the Lady added some for herself.—He was to have thirty Pounds a Year, and some Perquisites, to enable him to be decent.
IN three Days they set out for England.— The Friends parted with great Regret, and took a most tender Adieu. Pensé gave a Hint, that in all Likelihood a War would soon break out, and begg'd of Conyers never to write to him.



CHAP. XXI.


—Fie, fie upon her!
There's Language in her Eye, her Cheek, her Lip:
Nay, her Foot speaks; her wanton Spirits look out
At every Joint, and Motion of her Body:
Oh, these Encounterers! so glib of Tongue,
They give a coasting Welcome ere it comes;
And wide unclasp the Tables of their Thoughts
To every ticklish Redder: Set them down
For sluttish Spoils of Opportunity,
And Daughters of the Game.

SHAKESPEAR'S Troilus &amp; Cressida.



JACK was soon settled in a Family-way in London, but found a mighty Difference between his last and present Master. My Lord had a fine House, and a Number of Servants were maintain'd at a vast Expence; yet the Whole was conducted in so slovenly a Manner, that nothing was in Order, and something was always wanting to compleat the intended Elegance.—Madam Haughty ruled all, and govern'd with

a Power as uncontroul'd as it was extensive. She frequently school'd his Lordship in such Terms, that made Conyers conceive an utter Aversion for her. Some Times she had violent Fits of Jealousy, and on those Occasions my Lord was never permitted to approach, neither could any Rhetorick, except that of a Purse, persuade her into any tolerable Temper.—Her male Acquaintances were Singers, Fidlers, young Fops, and a Couple of worn-out Sharpers. Her female Friends were Milliners, Mantua-Makers of small Repute, and some Nymphs of her own Order. For these a plentiful Table was kept, and the Incense of Praise was constantly perfuming on the Altars of the Goddess Haughty. Tho' the House was perpetually crowded, yet properly speaking, Lord Weakhead saw no Company.
MADAM HAUGHTY had a strong Levée almost every Morning; and, because she had been in France, and heard something of the Conduct of their Ladies of Quality, she frequently received their Visits in Bed. Conyers always made the Tea, and, with a Footman, attended the Duty of the Table. One Morning, when the Company were pretty numerous, Jack was busy employ'd in this Office, but happening to go into the Lady's Dressing-Room, he found a Bottle

with a Label, on which was wrote Mouth Water; and, as his Gums were swell'd with a Cold, he innocently used this Water as a Gargle. Whilst he was filling out the Tea, his Lips shrunk up, and his Mouth almost clos'd. The Company could not forbear smiling at the Oddity of his Face, which was quite distorted. Madam, at last perceived the Queerness of his Phiz, and, with a Laugh, ask'd him, What was the Matter? When he attempted to answer, his whole Face was in Convulsions; but, as he could not articulate a Word, he ran to the Dressing-Room, and produced the Bottle. Haughty burst into a violent Laugh, and whisper'd a Lady near her, who communicated the Secret to a Third, and in a Moment all present were in the utmost Mirth; and a thousand Witticisms were thrown out, till Conyers was oblig'd to quit his Station, and seek Refuge in his Chamber, where, with Patience and warm Water, he brought his Features to their accustom'd Regularity; but it was not till some Years after, he found out what had occasion'd his Disorder, and the immoderate Banter he suffer'd.
MRS. HAUGHTY carry'd her Ridicule so far, that it raised his Resentment, and determin'd him to watch her Motions more

narrowly. In the mean Time he could not avoid making some serious Reflections on the Conduct and Situation of Lord Weakhead. He thought that the Life of a Man of Quality was to be employ'd in shewing good Examples to the World; and, with some Sighs, compar'd the Behaviour of his present Master to that of Lord True good.—He was surpriz'd how a Peer could run from the Dignity his Ancestors had purchas'd, and act below the Character of the meanest Mechanic. He was astonish'd that a Nobleman, who might almost command the best Society, and a Lady of the first Family, where good Sense and Honour would grace his Table, should renounce these rational Comforts, and amuse himself with the Dregs of Mankind, and a Woman of a most abandon'd Life. He was at last convinced, that his poor Lord had all the Plagues the worst Wife could give, without any one of those Pleasures she might sometimes bestow.
THIS Lady hath discover'd, that Delicacy and Tenderness were not the Charms most admir'd by my Lord in a Mistress, but that his Constitution was to be govern'd only by absolute Power. The more she seem'd to hate and despise him, the fonder he grew. Her insolent Security was such,

that she scarcely made a Secret of her Infidelity, so that Conyers caught her one Morning beating Time to the Musick of a dirty Fidler. She colour'd a little, at being so fairly discover'd; but, with a matchless Assurance, propos'd his taking a Part in the Concert. Conyers, with a Smile of Disdain, answer'd, He had too good a Taste, to be charm'd with a common vulgar Ballad. Her Rage is not to be express'd, she swore like an old Dragoon; and in this Temper he quitted her in Contempt.
AMONGST the many who paid Court to my Lord and Madam Haughty, Mr. Sangfroid, a young Surgeon of French Extraction, was pretty constant. He had a particular Regard for Conyers, and was the only Person who found out his Value and Merit. Sangfroid was a Man of Sense, and whose Conversation was seriously diverting, and his speaking French extremely well, made Conyers fond of being often with him. To this Gentleman he told his Story, and begg'd his Advice. I see, said Sangfroid, you are not perfectly acquainted with this Part of the World. I have sometimes interfered between a Gentleman and his Wife, and have made up mighty Quarrels occasion'd by Lap-Dogs, Parrots, and the like; but I never meddle between

a Gentleman and his Mistress. It is of too sacred and delicate a Nature, neither can my Probe search to the Bottom of the Wound; and, as I perceive that a Mortification must of Necessity ensue, why should I give my Patient unnecessary Pain? However, continued he, don't repine at being dismissed this Service, but live with me until I can provide you another. 
Conyers return'd him many Thanks, and that Evening accepted his kind Invitation, for my Lord very gravely paid him three Months Wages, and gave him a Discharge.
MR. SANGFROID received him with great Kindness, and apologiz'd for not having it in his Power to be more constantly with him, but he never fail'd at Dinner, and seldom in the Evenings. In these Conversations Conyers took Care to ingratiate himself with his new Friend, and display'd his Learning and Accomplishments in so agreeable a Manner, as not a little surprized the Surgeon, who confess'd he merited an happier Fate: But, continued he, it shall not be my Fault, if something don't turn out to your Advantage.

CONYERS pass'd his Time in a very satisfactory Manner, for Sangfroid entertain'd him with Histories of sundry Families, but

with such Humour, as created Abundance of Mirth and most useful Observations; which last, Jack constantly added to his Collection.

ONE Evening our Friends had agreed to go to a favourite Play, where Mr. Sangfroid met several of his Acquaintance. 'I see, said he to Conyers, a Knot of choice Spirits in the third Row; should they ask me to a Tavern, I must desire your Company; for, though it will be Time thrown away, it will not be lost.' 'I cannot, reply'd Conyers, rightly understand your Distinction, but command me.' 'That young Gentleman, continued

the Surgeon, in a white Fustian Frock, and checquer'd Flannel Waistcoat, with the Hat of a Stage Coachman, is Sir Nicholas Royster of Yorkshire, who inherits good four thousand Pounds a Year. He's not yet of Age, but borrows Money enough, by insuring his Life. That elderly Youth just by him, with a red Face, is Squire Morise, formerly of High Hall in Gloucestershire. That fine Seat, and fifteen hundred a Year round it, has been long purchased by Mr. Punctual, a Banker in the Strand, on which the Squire has two hundred a Year Life-Rent. That genteel young Man on the other Side, is one Mr. Fitz-Simons of Ireland, where, I imagine, he has a good Fortune, for he is extremely generous. He has Chambers in the Middle Temple, and for these three Years has study'd very closely. A little beyond him you see a portly fierce Gentleman in Scarlet, with a Point d' Espagne Hat so cock'd, that it frights the Orange Wenches. He is called Major Noisy, and, I have been told, was formerly a Lieutenant in the Army, but was oblig'd to sell out and retire on Ensign's Half-pay; but the Knight is his Friend.' —'I think, said Conyers, you apply the Word fierce to the Major; now, as I apprehend,

it is derived from, the French Word fier, which means proud and saucy, I beg you will give him some other Epithet, for I observe he is extremely familiar with the Orange Ladies, who seem to attack him with equal Freedom.'— Your Observation, said Sangfroid, I believe is right, but really the Major is far from being proud; but how fier may answer to saucy, I hope to convince you: However, they are all my Friends and Customers; and the Plague of my Profession is, I must not only keep them Company, but agree to every Thing they say, when in Company.'
THE Play was scarcely finished, when the Major gave a loud Hem, and having fix'd Sangfroid's Eyes, call'd out, —The King's Arms, and received a Nod of Consent.— Sir Nicholas and his Company got first to the Tavern, having pick'd up two special City Sparks. When Mr. Sangfroid and Conyers arriv'd, they found the Major and the rest very loud at the Larder. With great Difficulty Supper was order'd, and the Master, Mr. Ryan, conducted them into the Rose.— As an Historian, I am compell'd to attend, but, courteous Reader, if thou'rt not charm'd with Discord of harsh Sounds,—If a Tavern Scene delighteth not

thy Heart, or, if thou findest thyself not disposed for a Conversation with such Company, go not thou in with me, but pass on to some other Part of this delectable History.
THE Instant the Major enter'd the Rose, he cry'd out, Z—ns! what a Room has the Rascal put us into?—Here— You Son of a W—re, shew us into the Rummer, this smokes like Hell!—Ryan was all Obedience, and, as he conducted them back, the Knight could not avoid saying, Ay, ay, let the old Soldier alone; D— me he'll keep 'em all in Order.— The usual Salutations began, and Mr. Sangfroid introduced Conyers to each, by their Titles.—Sir, said the Major, give me your Hand. D—n all these Compliments; you seem, Sir, to be a Gentleman, and a Man of Honour, and D— me but we're all oblig'd to Young Bolus for your Company.—Conyers just began to return the Compliment, but the Major interrupted him, saying,—'Sir, You are a very pretty sensible Gentleman, and (ringing the Bell as loud as he could) we'll take a hearty Bottle together, and know me for your Friend.—Here—You Ostler —D— me, where is the Wine.'— Please your Honour, said the Waiter, the

Wine your Honour always chuses is on the Table.'—'D'ye prate, Puppy? said he, to Kennel, down this Instant,— Avaunt!'—The Waiter retir'd with a Smile, and then he began, Come, Boys, —Come Lads, sit down and be D—d, and take your Wine in Peace and Quietness.

THE Company were moving to their Places, when Mr. Morise open'd with an hoarse Voice,—D—n that old Firelock, what a Clatter he makes; curse him, he'll never be a Conjurer, for he wan't born dumb.—This witty Stroke occasion'd a prodigious Laugh, which lasted with many Additions, till all had taken their Seats.
I HOPE it will not be expected I should set down minutely and in Order every single Word and Repartee during the first half Hour's Conversation. The Task would be too arduous even for the renown'd Author of Pamela and Clarissa, whose Patience nothing could equal, except that of his Readers. Old Bunyan would have been at a Loss, and the celebrated Mr. Cleveland would have found it impossible; how therefore can I, a weak, ignorant Modern, pretend to attempt what such vast Geniuses must have omitted. All I am able to do,

is to beg the learned Reader to supply my Defects, by imagining, or, if he can, writing about thirty Pages of the most fashionable Oaths, and refin'd Bawdy Jokes his Wit can put together. Should his Thoughts not be sufficiently elevated for so sublime a Subject, let him take the Memoirs of a Lady of Pleasure, whose Author, as he undoubtedly merits, certainly ought to be preferr'd to the highest Post on Hounslow, or some other convenient Heath.

WHILST the Supper was laying, Mr. Sangfroid whisper'd his Friend, that Sir Nicholas had pawn'd his Honour they would have no Whores in Company that Night, for I hope, added the Surgeon, to amuse you in a better Manner.—Supper over, they had just set down to fresh Bottles when Mr. Ryan enter'd. Please your Honours, said he, here's the Gazette, and great News in it, will your Honour, giving it to the Major, be pleas'd to read it, for 'tis bespoke in the next Room. —I read it! cry'd the Major, 
No, not I by G—, read it yourself and be d—d.— Ryan began, and read of a powerful Squadron fitted out at Brest, and that forty thousand French had Orders to march to Germany, and the like Number to the Frontiers of Flanders. That the Queen of Hungary

was levying a large Army in Bohemia, which would be ready to take the Field early in the Spring.—He was proceeding, when the Major jump'd up, drew his Sword, and slapping it on the Table, 'Now, cry'd he, we shall have a War, 'D—n my Blood but we shall. Now the Scoundrels will court me to shew them the Way to Flanders, and the Prig Officers who will hardly give me a Bow, shall come Cap in Hand, for they can't make me less than a Lieutenant Colonel. Z—ds! How I long to be at it, and then, Sir Nicholas, D—me, Sir Nicholas, but you shall go with me, and be my Ensign, and fight by my Side, D—me if you shan't.—Not so fast, said the Knight, for, D—me if I do. No, no, I know a Trick worth two of that, for, as the Gentleman said to Night in the Play, I've four thousand a Year of as good fighting Land as any in Europe; so I suppose if we have a War I shall pay my Club, and you and your Honour and Glory may go fight and be d—d for Sir Nicholas.' 'Then, cry'd the Hero, stay at home and be d—d, and mind your Hounds and your Horses. Z—ds, when I was of your Age,'—Why, said Sangfroid, when you were of Sir Nicholas's Age,

what mighty Matters did your Honour do? Come, tell us, my dear Man of War.

I was, said the Major, the eighth Son of fourteen, for we were always a fine Bucking Family. My Father, Justice Noisy, 'tis well known, had two thousand a Year in Cornwall, and gave his Children as much Learning as they would take. Your Latin and Greek was not my Turn, and the Fool my Master flogg'd me damnably before he found it out, which happen'd by an odd Accident, for when I was about Fifteen, the Son of a B—h was at his old Tricks with his Birch, but d—me if I didn't take him such a Knock over the Noddle with the Poker, that down dropt Old Ars in presente, and the best of the Joke was, that the Scoundrel was a Parson. The old Justice laugh'd heartily, and prais'd my Spirit, so I thought I had him on. I wanted d—ly to get to London, but my Chap was as close fisted as the Devil, and not a Stiver would he part with to buy me a Commission, which was all my Pride. The old Fool at last married a young B—h for Love, and used me like a Dog. D—me thought I but I'll be reveng'd, and you'll split your Sides with laughing when I tell you how I contriv'd it.—D—n my

Blood if I didn't make Love to my Mother, and fairly Cuckol'd Old Square-toes.' Bravo, Bravo, cry'd Sir Nicholas, and Bravo, cry'd all the Rest. Well, said Sangfroid, so when you had Cuckol'd your Father you—Z—ns, Mr. Purge, cry'd the Major, sure I can tell my own Story. —Why, when I had done him that Jobb, D—me, thought I, but I'll do you another; so one Morning I made free with a Purse of Fifty Guineas, and, as the Devil would have it, the same Day he found Madam and I fairly planting his Horns. —Z—ns! how he stared, and swore and rag'd like any Free-man in Bedlam. I walk'd off, my Dears, and left him that Bone to pick the best Way he could.— Well, as I was saying, I walk'd off, and took the Road to London. As I had Money in my Purse, I thought I had all the World in a String. In a Week I got acquainted with some fine Ladies, and very fond of me they were, for D—me but I was as fine a Lad as ever trod the Ground, and five Foot Seven in my Stocking Feet. The dear B—hes soon made me known to some Gentlemen of Quality, so that in about a Month I knew Drury-Lane and London as well as if I had been bred and born in't; but

D—me if I know to this Day how it was, but in six Weeks I'd but a single Guinea left.—Now some Lads would have snivel'd and cry'd, and begged Pardon, and so forth; not me by G—d. I kept up my Heart like a Man, and as I could not purchase a Red Rag, I bravely resolved to earn one with my Sword, so I went to the Parade, and took on in the First Regiment of Guards.—The Company greatly applauded his Courage and Resolution, and he proceeded—A Trifle, a Trifle, Gentlemen. Boys of Spirit will always, sooner or later, strike out their own Fortunes.—Well, this was in the Year 1711, which all the World knows was about the Middle of that red hot War.—To cut short my Story, we landed near Lisle, which my Glorious Master the Duke of Marlborough was Besieging, and the same Day I begged to mount the Trenches.—Hot Work, hot Work my Boys, for there was we exposed on the Top of a Ditch to the Fire of the Enemy for four Hours Endways. —Come, Gentlemen, drink about, Sorrow is dry, and d—me but I'm choaking with Thirst.—They drank, but whilst the Knight and Mr. Morise were asking some Particulars of the Siege, Conyers found

Time to say to his Friend,—This Fellow was never an Officer, and I verily believe was never in any Army except as a Sutler's Servant.—Just then the Major's Voice was distinct.—Lord, Lord, said he, why there it is. People that stay at Home and see nothing, must have strange Notions. To be sure 'tis terrible enough at first, D—me if it isn't, but when a Man is us'd to it for four or five Campaigns as I was, 'tis a mere Flea-bite.— Well, as I was saying, having cut a Passage through the covered Way, and with fixed Bayonets mastered the Half Moon of the first and second Parapets, and a Breach being made in the Glacis by our Engineers, I boldly mounted, and the whole Army following, the poor Devils of French surrender'd the Town.—The Gazette did me Justice, and the Noble General made me an Ensign. At Blenheim the next Campaign, I did my Duty, got a few Wounds and a Company, and the same Year a Majority.—You know the rest. My old Dad kick'd up, and like an unnatural Son of a Whore as he was, left me a Shilling. A d—d Peace being made, and a Boy put over my Head, I quitted the Service, and have been on Half-Pay ever since, but now—

D—n my Blood they shall beg and pray before they catch me in Flanders.— So drink about my Boys, I'm alive, D—me.

THE Bottle and Wit went briskly round, till Sangfroid, clapping Sir Nicholas on the Shoulder, 'There, said he, there's a Fellow of Mettle: I think I see him routing a whole French Army; I wish he'd write his Memoirs, they'd sell d—d well. What would you give, Sir Knight, to be able to say as much as the Major?'— Give, reply'd Sir Nicholas, D—me, I'd not give Six-pence. To be sure the Fellow may have seen more, for he's old enough to be my Grandfather, but d—n my Blood, I've done as much for my Time, as any He in Christendom.'— Impossible, Impossible, said Sangfroid,— Judgment, Judgment, cry'd the Knight, and in a Quarter of an Hour, Silence was proclaimed, and he began.

WHY, lookee, Gentlemen, I was but Nineteen, as I may say, last Grass. My good Father Sir Joseph, and my Lady Mother were very tender of my Youth, and gave me all the Education a Gentleman of my Fortune requir'd. At ten Years old I could read,—no body better, —and the same Year I rode one of my

Father's Horses, poor Merry Pintle, and won the Sweep Stakes at Wakefield Races. D—me if I didn't.—Z—ns! I thought the old Gentleman would have leapt out of's Skin for Joy.—Next Day, my Bucks, I ran old Sly Boots against Squire Mason's Bay Mare Miss Slammekin, a Bye Match for Fifty Guineas, Weight for Inches. Honest Sly-boots had well nigh distanc'd the Mare, when he lost all Four, and canted me twenty Yards over his Head. There I lay, and was taken up for dead, tho' I only broke my left Arm and two of my Ribs.—No more by G—. When I recovered of my Wounds, all my Friends said that Young Nick was fairly entred.—Come Bucks, drink about.—Well, next Year, D—me if I didn't out-ride our Huntsman in a Fox Chace, and made him hellishly Jealous; but in leaping a double Ditch, I got a Tumble, and my Head fell foul of a d—d Stump of a Tree, and laid it open. See Gentlemen, see, (pulling off a little black Wig) here it is, you may put your Fingers in't, but, D—me, I soon hors'd for all that, and call'd out Jowler, —Ringwood,—Ho.
—Then he display'd all the Eloquence of Field Language, and the Company joining in the Cry, the Guardian

of the Night forgot the Hour, and imagined himself in Epping Forrest.—At Length Sir Nicholas found Time to proceed.—All the Tenants was cock sure I'd be a clever Fellow; but when I began to kill their Dogs, and break their Nets, the Scoundrels complain'd to Sir Joseph, and my good Lady Mother gave me a swinging Lecture about good Nature and Humanity, and such Stuff; but when I was Sixteen, I shew'd them other Game, for D—me if I didn't get their Daughters with Child by Dozens, and at last I tipt the same Favour to her Ladyship's Maid. Sir Joseph curs'd and swore, and my Lady cry'd and pray'd like Hell and the Devil; but what did I care?—I knew they cou'dn't swear or pray me out of the Estate, do their worst; so because they wou'dn't let me take my Swing at Home, I touched the Steward for a Brace of Hundreds, and wished 'em all a good Night.—My dear Father at last relented his hard Usage of me, and about four Months ago he took a Leap in the Dark to Kingdom come; and so I'm in Mourning for him, as you see.—A loud Laugh ensued, and the Bottle took its Course, and then he continued—My Guardians, for I've enough of 'em, won't allow me to

live like a Gentleman, but D—me they are bit; I won't starve in a Cook's Shop, not I, for, my Bucks, here I am safe, and by the Help of my Friend yonder, pretty sound. Now, Gentlemen, I think I've been in more Dangers than if I had fought twenty Battles in Flanders, and D—me I'll lay Fifty Guineas I've more Wounds than his Honour the Major.

EVERY Body agreed, and poor Noisy stood a whole Volly of Wit.—'Truce, Boys, Truce, cry'd the Major, Why what the Devil, all upon Roger!—Fitzsimons, do dear Rogue, tell us some of your foolish Exploits, and keep Sir Nicholas in Countenance.'—'I'd do as much for you, said Fitzsimons, with all my Heart, but it seems you have no Occasion, for the Devil himself can't put you out of Countenance.'—This encreased the Laugh, till Sangfroid cry'd out, Well, Gentlemen, I must own the Major has said a good Thing once in his Life, and I second the Motion; to Order Gentlemen, to Order, Mr. Fitzsimons is up,—hear him, hear him.
—All the Cry now was hear him, so Fitzsimons was obliged to comply, and he began.
'MY History, Gentlemen, is very short. —My Family is pretty considerable in

Ireland, where my Father kept a good House, and lived in the true old hospitable Manner, but still gave his five Sons such Accomplishments as the Country afforded. We knew Latin and Greek, but Dancing and Fencing much better. At last the good Man died, and I, as his eldest Son, took Possession of the Estate, charged with my Mother's Jointure, and Portions for younger Children. To do the best I could for a large Family, I entered the Temple, and stinted myself to One Hundred Pounds a Year. I have many Relations in London, and some of Fashion, who introduced me into the politest Company of both Sexes, where I soon found I had a Genius for Play, and improved my Talent.—But, Gentlemen, the Ladies, the Ladies are kind, for I court them in such a Manner that few can withstand my Rhetorick.'—'Z—ns, cry'd the Knight, I'd give a Thousand Pounds for that Secret.'—'You may have it much cheaper, reply'd Fitzsimons, for when I am with a Lady I like, or whose Eyes speak a certain Language, I watch the first Opportunity, and
Usher the New Acquaintance, &amp;c.


D—me, cry'd the Major, If I know what you mean. I know well enough a Man may be ushered to the King's Bench, or the Poultry, or the Round House, and the like, where a Man may make new Acquaintances enough, but D—me if ever I heard of ushering a new Acquaintance to a Lady, but by a Pimp.'—'Why you old B—h, cry'd Sir Nicholas, don't you know that new Acquaintances are New Guineas, and that little Fitz slily tipt the Lady half a Score?—D—me after all, 'tis the only best Argument in the World.'—'Right, right, Sir Nicholas, said the Surgeon, 'fore Gad you have hit it.'

THE Knight is so sharp, said Fitzsimons, there is no hiding Things from him.—If the Lady accepts my little Rouleau I am sure of her immediately. If she refuses, and afterwards permits my Visits, I try her again, and seldom have Occasion to repeat the Dose. From this I have the Advantage of being of her Family, as often as I please; and if it encreases not my Revenue, it at least prevents a Decrease by another Channel. —This, Gentlemen, is my Amusement, but my grand Resources are the Chocolate Houses.— When Salkeild, and Cook,

and Ventris, and Littleton, begin to grow dry and stupid, I turn about and converse with my good Friend Monsiéur de Moivre, on the Doctrines of Chances.— Perhaps, said Mr. Morise, that same Mr. De—what d'ye call him, may be a pretty Fellow; I don't know him; but for Salkeild and the rest, I've seen 'em drunk and sober enough, and by the L—d they are stupid Mortals.' — That may be, said the Major, for D—me if I know any of 'em; but, dear Morise, not to interrupt you, I've often heard some of your Tip-top People say that your Littleton is a d—d clever Fellow;—but I beg Pardon, and, my dear Fitz, don't let us talk of Religion; D—n your Doctrine, and finish your Story.


WITH all my Heart, said Fitzsimons, for two Words will do it.—In short, Gentlemen, I am Master at Piquet, and could teach Whist to Mr. Hoyle. I care not how the World goes, for one Lord pays for my Chariot, another keeps my Servants and Horses, and many of different Titles contribute to my Family-Expences.—Thus, Gentlemen, I live, and live well, tho' the good old Gentlewoman keeps her Jointure.



Z—NS, cry'd Sir Nicholas, you're a happy Fellow, but I am the most unlucky Dog in the World.—There's my Mother now,—D—me, she has no more Nature in her than a Stone; for, if she lov'd her only Child, or my poor defunct Father, to be sure she'd have contrived some Way or other to have paid him a Visit by this Time.—But no Matter, for whether her Jointure falls in or not, by G—I'm determined next Bout to be Knight of the Shire, if it costs me Twenty Thousand Pounds.

THE highest Encomiums were ready to fall on Sir Nicholas, when Mr. Morise rose in an Extacy, crying out, 'D—me I must kiss the dear Boy.—Do, dear Sir Nick, stand for the County, and here I am that will support you with all my Interest, and be your Manager; for by the L—d, no Man in Europe understands that Matter better.'—'I thought, said Mr. Sangfroid, your Estate lay in another County.'—'You thought, reply'd Morise, Psha, D—it, why Man, all the World knows I've stood for Twenty Boroughs and Counties, and was a Member too in the Queen's Time; but that D—d new Ministry threw me out, and I've been fighting them ever since; but next P—t,

I think I have a Borough pretty sure.'— Ay, ay, Master Morise, said the Major, let it alone till then, and then you may think on't, for that will be your Share.'— Why, you dirty Scoundrel, cry'd Morise, do you upbraid me in my Misfortunes, that has kept you from starving?'— Patience good Mr. Morise, said the Major, Starving! Ay, ay, D—me if you kept me like yourself, I should starve indeed.'—Morise lost all Temper, and whilst he discharged a thousand hard Names, and not a few Glasses on the Major, the Warrior practised his own Lesson of Patience, and received them with great Meekness, still crying out,—Mr. Morise, Mr. Morise,—don't rouse the angry Lyon.—Morise drew his Sword, but some held him, and some the Major, whose Sword, by this Time, was unsheath'd.— The Storm was violent. The Major's Voice was Thunder, and Morise's the Echo to it.—Mr. Ryan and the Waiters entered, which added not a little to the Harmony. —Now might be heard Oaths, Imprecations, Prayers and Intreaties rushing instantly out; but no Mortal could distinguish or assign a Reason.
AT last the Noise of War seemed to subside, and gentle Peace began to spread her

Pinions. The mangled Limbs of slaughtered Bottles and Glasses were decently interred, and the purple Stream, that covered Half the Plain, was now swallowed up by the neighbouring Sands. All Preliminaries being adjusted, Tranquillity was proclaimed, and three Bottles called for, to sacrifice to Love and Friendship.—Bumpers went briskly round, and their Zeal was so fervent to establish a right Understanding, that some of the Company began to lose their own.

Z—NS, cry'd the Knight, what Fools were we to quarrel amongst ourselves, when the common Enemy is at Hand?— D—me, my Bucks, let's sally forth and beat the Watch!'—'Glorious Thought! said the Major, and let's beat up the Bawdy-Houses.'—'I'm with you, cryed Morise, by the L—d 'tis the most finest Fun in the Universe.—To pay—a Bill this, Instant, and let's to Business.—All seemed to join, and whilst the Bill was preparing, Sir Nicholas settled the Operations.
THE Reckoning was Three Pounds Eighteen Shillings, and each Man put his Hand to his Pocket.—The Major laughed, and swearing he had changed his Breeches that Morning, and forgot to shift his Money,

added, 'Tis no great Matter, for my Servant is an honest Fellow; however, Sir Nick, tip me a Guinea till I see you next.—The Knight readily comply'd, and Mr. Conyers saying, It is just our Half Guineas a-piece,
threw one on the Table.—Morise whispered somewhat to Sir Nicholas, who immediately cryed out, Z—ns, that's true, D—my B—d if the Gentleman pays a Farthing in my Company.—Conyers begged to be excused; but the other insisting on paying the Whole, threw four Guineas to the Waiter. Mr. Morise took the Half Guinea, intreating Mr. Conyers to put it up; which he peremptorily refusing, Well, said Morise, 'tis only so much the more for the Waiter; however, in a Mistake, he slipt it into his own Pocket.
'TWAS past three o'Clock, and the Quiet of the Neighbourhood was to be invaded, the Company in the Street, each encouraging the other in the Expedition.—But my Duty calls me another Way, for Mr. Conyers took the first Chair, and got safe to his Lodgings, without sharing in the Honours or Danegrs of this glorious Action, and his Friend very soon followed his Example.



CHAP. XXIII.


O that I had my Innocence again!
My untouch'd Honour! but I wish in vain:
The Fleece that has been by the Dyer stain'd,
Never again its native Whiteness gain'd.

WALLER.




SANGFROID was rous'd about Six that Morning, by a thundering Rap at the Door. At Ten he return'd, and gave Conyers the Sequel to the Evening's Entertainment.—There has been fine Work, said he, and our Heroes have furnish'd me Employment. It seems they began their Attack on the Watchmen a little too precipitately, so were instantly outnumber'd. The Battle lasted but a short Time, and in the Hurry, the Major and Mr. Morise got off to a Bagnio, but most miserably cut in the Head and Face.— The Valour of the young Knight not permitting him the proper Use of his Legs, he was taken Prisoner, and conducted to the Citadel of the Parish, vulgarly

term'd the Round-House. He is tolerably bruised, and has another honourable Mark planted just over his Eye. Some of the Watch are slightly injur'd, but as they will make the most of it, this Affair, perhaps, may be made up at the trivial Expence of an Hundred Guineas.

'BUT, said Conyers, what became of the other Gentleman? For methinks Mr. Fitzsimons is a Man of more Understanding than to embarque in such an Exploit.' —'He (answer'd the Surgeon) slipp'd off with me, and whisper'd, "He had no Idea of Fighting, where nothing but the Reverse of Honour or Credit could possibly be obtain'd."—As for the City Blades, all I hear of them is, that they play'd their Parts very well for some Time, but had so much Prudence as not to be taken.'
'I AM heartily glad, said Conyers, that some have been properly punish'd; for their Conduct is so absurd, that nothing can extenuate it, but imagining them Lunatick.'—'In truth, said Sangfroid, the Watchmen treated them as such, and blooded them severely.—But what think you of their Humour?—'Humour! reply'd Conyers, Faith I find none, but

for Ribaldry, Folly, and Nonsense, I thank my Stars, I never heard nor saw more in my whole Life. I was quite silent, and bore all their Extravagancies with some Patience, except their horrid Swearings, which really made me shudder.'—'And yet, said his Friend, such is the general Run of Tavern-Conversation.'—'I am sorry for it, answer'd Conyers; but wonder what Joy, what Pleasure Men can take, especially old ones, in Riot and Excess! Company, and too much Wine, may sometimes lead Men into a thousand odd Frolicks, but a cool, deliberate System of Ignorance, Debauchery and Impiety, is what I can by no Means account for. Dean Swift, indeed, was not so much astonish'd at seeing Men wicked, as at their not being asham'd of it.'—'That, said Sangfroid, is really the most surprizing Circumstance; but of our Companions, I can only say, as Killigrew did of Lord Wharton, "they would not swear at that abominable Rate, if they thought they were doing God Honour.' Many Observations pass'd, till the Surgeon told him, they would dine Tomorrow with a Lady on the Surry Side, where possibly he might be more happily and more agreeably entertain'd.

NEXT Day they took Boat. The Lady, said Sangfroid, we are going to visit, was formerly call'd POLLY GUN, but lately POLLY CANNON, and has been what the World calls, One of Us. She has had her Share of Variety, but managed so cleverly, as to have an Income of about Two Hundred Pounds a Year. She is now about Forty-five Years of Age, preserves a Portion of Beauty, and has for these Four last Years retir'd from the Town, and lives a most regular and modest Life. She has been often in Keeping, but had always a Settlement by Way of Life-Annuity. I transact all her Affairs, and am on such a Footing, that I hope to persuade her to give you her History. You'll be pleas'd with her Conversation, for she is extremely well-bred, and of a lively and chearful Turn.

THEY row'd up the River about Six Miles, Conyers still enquiring into more Particulars, which furnish'd Sangfroid with an Opportunity of describing her Person, her Oeconomy, her Happiness, and other Articles, till they landed. A Quarter of an Hour brought them to her House: It was small, but most neatly furnish'd, with a Garden in nice Order. The first Salutations over, Mrs. Cannon fell into the easy

and familiar Stile. She very agreeably rally'd the Magnificence of her Palace, the Elegance of the Apartments, and the Spaciousness of the Saloon. As she went through the few Rooms, she made very merry Remarks.—'Now, Gentlemen, said she, this is my Bed-Chamber, and contains somewhat scarcely to be found in any other.'—'I must own, Madam, said Conyers, I never saw so truly a clean, neat, and charming an Apartment in my Life, but the Bed strikes my Imagination the most.—What Joy, what Content must Repose and Slumber find in it!'—'Oh, very fine, said she; but tho' your Guess is very true, permit me to set you Right in the Main.—This Bed, continued she, I made myself, and have for these Four Years constantly slept in it as happily as I wish or desire; but few Beds can boast, like this, of being never employ'd but merely to sleep in.' —Sangfroid laugh'd, and Conyers smil'd. —'You may laugh, Gentlemen, said she, yet Faith it is Fact.—But now let us go to the Library.' She then conducted them into a pretty contriv'd Closet, and shew'd about Three Hundred Volumes of History, Poetry, and Books of Divinity.' —I doubt not, said she, but some great

Personages may have a larger Collection, but perhaps they cannot say with me, that they have read all their's more than once over.—Yonder are the Classicks in good English.—You may examine them, if you please; for, I assure you, they are not in Wood, and design'd for Ornament only.—Conyers and the Surgeon found something to say on every Volume, nor did she fail in very pertinent Replies.
SHE then led them to her Garden:— 'Here, said she, is the fair Flower in its Lustre! What Pity to crop its growing Sweetness, then cast it like a loathsome Weed away.'—'Pity, indeed, Madam, said Conyers; but to transplant, to cherish it in your fair Garden, where the Sun always shines, has been your careful Employment; but however, to let it wither and perish on the Stem, without smelling its Fragrancy, is, perhaps, a Crime almost as bad. For my Part, I should enjoy its Perfume, and endeavour to keep it in constant Blow.'—'Yes, yes, said she, I never knew a young Fellow that did not imagine he'd make an excellent Gardener.—But here comes my Maid, and I prophecy Dinner is ready.'—As

they walk'd to the House, the Surgeon gave her a Whisper.
THE Repast was plain, but so neat, and enliven'd by such Good Humour and Chearfulness, that Conyers declar'd he never had so high an Entertainment.—Sangfroid put her in Mind of the Promise she made him. —Since, said she, your Friend Mr. Conyers is so curious, I shall give him a History, of which I make no great Secret.



The STORY of POLLY GUN, OTHERWISE POLLY CANNON.

WHO, or what were my Parents, is of no Consequence, only I must say they were People of Substance and Reputation, and most tenderly bred and educated me. I grew up like other Wenches; and at Fourteen, the flattering World had talk'd me into Beauty. Perhaps I really was so, but am sure I

thought it. About this Time, one Mr. Tarrier, and his Lady, took a furnish'd House in our Neighbourhood. The good Gentlewoman was mighty religious, and never fail'd at the Parish Church. She took a great Liking to my Father's Pew, and, by many little Civilities, was much regarded by our Family. She invited us to Supper, and was invited in Return. In a Word, her Conversation was so pious and godly, and she inveigh'd so much against the Wickedness and Vices of the present Age, that my poor Parents became so fond of, and intimate with her, that they intreated she would be so good to instruct their dear Polly. I own I was not much pleas'd with my Tutoress, for she constantly trail'd me to Church twice a-Day. My good Mother thank'd God she had found so good a Friend; but I soon discover'd that Madam Tarrier was not so outrageously rigid as I expected; for she sometimes persuaded them to permit me to a Play. The pious Lady always chose a Comedy, and in some Parts, where I was ignorant of the Joke, she very kindly explain'd, perhaps more than the Author meant.
IN this Manner we lived for about Half a Year, and the good Woman had got

such an Ascendancy over my Mother, that I believe she would have trusted me with her even to America. She frequently took me to visit her Uncle near Grosvenor-Square. He was a very polite, rich old Gentleman, and so kind to me, that I was always sure of some pretty Present, or a Guinea or two to buy Ribbands. At one, and the last of these Visits, Madam Tarrier took the Opportunity of leaving me with her Uncle, that she might attend her Devotions at a neighbouring Church. I thought she staid a little too long, and began to be impatient. The old Gentleman endeavoured to pass away the Time with a Chat fitting my Years, but at last I could not refrain crying most bitterly.—What need I amuse you with unnecessary Particulars?—The She Devil had left me with an He one, and I was undone.
THE first Month of my Confinement, for I was constantly watch'd, was dreadful to my Imagination. I most affectionately lov'd my Father and Mother, and felt their Sufferings at the Loss of an only Child. I wept almost Day and Night, but must say the old Gentleman was extremely tender and fond, and did all in his Power to make my Life easy.

He bought me Books, we read by Turns, and he gave me that Sort of Taste and Relish for them, which I now find of infinite Use. I play'd on the Harpsichord, and sung well; but he had a Master to perfect me and amuse my leisure Hours. I insensibly began to be better pleas'd with my Station, and in Twelve Months was quite reconciled to it.
WHAT an Animal is Man! — As I grew happy and fond of the Wretch, his Affections cool'd, and he entirely changed his Conduct. At last he upbraided me with Infidelity (which was impossible) and proved his Assertions by my injuring his Health. He storm'd and flew into a violent Passion; and calling his Man Jenkins, "Here, said he, take this fair Lady, get her a Lodging and a Surgeon, which I shall pay; but since she has found out a Trade, all she can expect of me, is to set her up."— Without giving me Time to reply, he stepp'd into his Chariot and vanished. — I was struck dumb; and tho' my Heart was ready to burst, no friendly Tear assisted me. Poor Jenkins was in great Perplexity; but one of the Maids having pack'd up all my Linen and Cloaths, of

which I had Abundance, and very fine, he was obliged to execute the Orders of his Master, and conducted me to the Door, where an Hackney Coach stood ready to receive me.
AS I was passing the Hall, I don't know what persuaded me to open the Parlour Door; but what was my Astonishment, when I saw Mrs. Tarrier, and a charming young Creature, in close Conversation!—I stood motionless, but in Agony, and with uplifted Eyes, I just utter'd—Infamous Woman! and fell in a Swoon.—The Servants too charitably brought me to myself, and Jenkins rather carried, than led me to the Coach.
WHEN we got to the Lodging he had provided for me, I flew to the Bed and abandon'd myself to Tears, Sighs, and the most melancholy Reflections.—Good God! said I, is there no Law, no Justice for the Injuries done me? Must I suffer in Silence, and must triumphant Villany go unpunished!—Is the Nature of Woman so harden'd, and the Conscience of Man so steel'd, as not to feel the utmost Remorse for this worse than Rape?—Bitter, very bitter were my Words, and Jenkins try'd all Means to assuage the Violence of my Passion. At length I became more calm,

and he promised to wait on me in the Morning. The Woman of the House obliged me to eat a little, and was very civil and tender.
NEXT Day Jenkins came and brought a Surgeon. When alone he began to question and examine me in the delicate Manner, and then declared I was injured in a high Degree.—'Twould be tedious to mention all this Affair; let it suffice, that I was perfectly recover'd in two Months.—As I could not accuse myself of a real Crime, I resolv'd, if possible, to return to my Parents, not doubting but they would receive me, and revenge my Wrongs. With proper Caution I persuaded my Landlady to make some Enquiry after them; but, Good Heavens! What were my Sufferings whilst she gave me the following Account?—"I have done, Madam, said she, what you have desir'd, and find that the Family I enquir'd after, had a beautiful Daughter who was stolen from them about a Year ago by a Bawd, who, as a Neighbour, got into their Favour, but decamp'd the Moment she finished her horrid Work. The poor Mother was so griev'd at the Loss of her Child, that she fell into a Decay, and died in Half a Year. The

Father, with Difficulty, got the better of his Afflictions, but sold all his Effects, and went Abroad, but where I could not learn. I assure you, Madam, that Family are greatly pity'd by all the Neighbours."—'My Situation is not to be described.— Now, said I, the worst has happen'd.—My dear Mother is dead, —My Father gone, — and I must be abandon'd to the Fate of a Prostitute!— But what signifies what becomes of me?
JENKINS just then enter'd, and, after some Chat, told me my Lodgings and Surgeon were paid; "and now, Polly, said he, your old Friend sends you these Fifty Guineas, and advises you to take Care of yourself."—I took the Money, but vented on the old Villain every Name, and every Imprecation my Rage could suggest.—"Come, come, said Jenkins, of what Use is all this? You must now think of providing a Maintenance; and if you'll be advis'd by me, perhaps Things may go better than you imagine. You are certainly a fine Girl, and some Gentlemen would think themselves happy in your Acquaintance. If you'll give me leave, I'll engage you shall not want two or three very liberal Friends.—You understand me."—I

was really, in such a Temper of Mind, and thought my Situation so desperate, that I did not reflect on the Misery I was going to plunge my self into, but consented to be guided by him and fell into his Project with a Sort of Stupidity that I never could account for.
JENKINS got me noble Lodgings properly situated and gave me his Instructions; but, like other Dealers, I gave him a Sample of the Goods. He had the Benefit of a Subscriber for Six Copies, by having the Seventh Gratis. He was a notable Broker, and sent many good Customers to my Ware-house.—In Six Months POLLY GUN began to be famous, and my Lodgings were sometimes the Scene of Quarrels and Noise, especially at Night. In short, Disgraces had knock'd too frequently at my Door, and the Neighbourhood oblig'd me to shift my Quarters.
IN three Years I believe I had thirty different Apartments, good and bad, just as the Ballance of Trade was For or Against me. 'Tis an odd Sort of Fund, for when Stock was low, I mounted to a Second or Third Story; when high, I descended to the First Floor. I had not seen Jenkins for some Time, so presume

he was instructing other Wenches whom his Master had made as wretched as myself.—By this Time some of my Cloaths were worn out, and many had visited the Pawn-Brokers.—I was frequented but by Lovers of the trifling Order.—I had not saved a Shilling, and wanted many Necessaries in my Profession, besides being indebted a Month's Lodging. In this Distress my Maid persuaded me to be acquainted with the Porters of two or three noted Taverns.—To these Places I was frequently sent for, and now took the Name of POLLY CANNON. The Novelty of my Face, my Conversation, which was always decent, my Voice, and my Youth and Compexion, furnish'd out a good or rather a bad Livelihood. The Porters were fond to promote my Interest, as I greatly promoted theirs.
THESE Gentlemen always charg'd a Shilling for my Chair hire to the Tavern, and another if I return'd alone to my Lodgings, tho' I was oblig'd to walk. If I got a Guinea, their Fee was a Crown, besides some other Dues, which I shall not mention. In short, these Fellows make a vast Income out of the Industry of poor young Ladies.

EVEN this Sort of Life at last fail'd me; for my Face grew too familiar, which is an unpardonable Crime amongst Gentlemen; and my biting the Porters out of their just Poundage, and refusing some certain Compliances which they regard as their Prerogative, they left me to pick my Teeth in my Chamber, and never invited poor Polly Cannon to a good Supper.
I COULD not starve.—With some Interest, I was inlisted under the Banners of a famous Lady near Covent-Garden. Not to be too minute in my Relation, I shall only say, I did tolerably well there for some Time; but a Quarrel between one of the Nymphs and I, obliged me to shift the Scene, and make a Piece of the Furniture of a Coffee-house.—As abandon'd as I was, I could never swear or drink. The Want of this last Qualification, made me soon discharg'd the Mansions of Drunkenness, and threw me, for Subsistance, into the Arms of the Publick.

WHY should I pretend to describe what no Mortal can exactly do? What Joy can you receive in my speaking Variety of Wretchedness? Or in a Tale, whose lightest Word would harrow up thy Soul!—

Cold, Famine and Pestilence were my constant Companions.—I breath'd, but devoutly wish'd every Moment might be my last. ROWE justly paints my Misery.

To know no Thought of Rest; to have the Mind
Still ministring fresh Plagues, as in a Circle,
Where one Dishonour treads upon another:
What know the Fiends beyond it!

HEAVEN help the unhappy Creatures groaning under this fatal Necessity, and forgive those who drove them to it!
ONE Night as I took my Rounds, I touch'd a young Gentleman, and in the usual Phrase, ask'd for a Pint of Wine. He turn'd, and by the Assistance of a Lamp, examined me a little, and consented.— "Perhaps, Child, said he, you are more Hungry than Dry."—On my telling him he guess'd right, he order'd a Supper.—Our Conversation became very diverting, and he was so good to say, I was much above the Common. He desired my Story, and I gave it him very naturally, but concluded, that as all

poor Girls were fertile in Invention, I much doubted if he credited my Tale.— He look'd serious, but from pitying he became amorous, and pressed my going to a Bagnio.—Wretched as I am, Sir, said I, I cannot do a Wilful Injury. You are happy and in Health, but I am miserable every Way.—When he was convinced of the Truth of what I said, he took me in his Arms, and vowed he would never forget my Generosity.— Take, said he, these Five Guineas, and meet me To-morrow Morning in Somerset-Gardens.

YOU may be sure I was punctual, and indeed he was exact. In fine, he carried me to the House of a Surgeon, where I remained until his Duty was over. My Friend, whose Name was Loveit, conducted me to a private Family, where, in a short Time, with good Living and tolerable Content of Mind, I recovered my former Spirits, my Complexion, and every Sign of Youth, for I was not yet quite One-and-Twenty.—If ever I lov'd a Man it was this dear Friend, and he merited all my Regard.
WITH this Gentleman I lived near three Years, and as happily as my Situation could admit of. I recover'd my

Musick and my Taste in Books, and greatly improved in both.—One Morning at Breakfast he walked about the Room, and seem'd very pensive. On my enquiring the Cause, he sat down by me and began thus.—"I hope, my dear Polly believes I love her as I ought, but all Things must have an End.—Don't be too much alarm'd, said he, on seeing my my Tears,—I shall act with Honour, and to your Satisfaction. — In two Words, Polly, my Friends and my real Interest compel me to marry."—Be happy, Sir, said I, in the Choice of a Wife, and may every Blessing attend you.' —'What remains for me but Dispair, Anxiety and Madness.—"Not so, my dear Polly, cry'd he, for I hope a better Fate attends you. Here are One Hundred Guineas, and this Paper intitles you to an Annuity of Forty Pounds a Year. Be careful of these and be happy.
HIS Generosity charmed me, and by Degrees he calmed my troubled Spirits, and brought me to talk of parting with more Coolness of Temper than I possibly could have imagined.—"Since we must separate, said he, take a little of my Advice. My Cousin, Captain Mizen, of the Superb Man of War, has seen and

likes you. As he knows all my Affairs, he begs to be admitted to your good Graces. The Captain is an Old Bluff Tar, and tho' not very polite and tender, yet he's an hearty honest Fellow. If you consent, I will engage a Settlement of Thirty Pounds, besides your living as you have hitherto done."—Some Conversation ensued, and at last I accepted the Proposal.
THE Evening was ushered in by a Visit from Captain Mizen, who was introduced by Mr. Loveit. I received them with great Respect, and made many Compliments for the Praises bestowed on me by my Friend.—"S'blood, said the Captain, what's all this Jawing for? I've done as Coz desired, and o'has the Papers in's Pocket. Now d'ye see, an it be too little, there's twenty Pieces more to turn the Scale.—Now, Mistress, how say you? shall we make the Bargain and seal Lips."—Loveit smiled, but I was mute.—"Well, well, said he, Silence gives Consent, so Mistress, by your Leave."—He kiss'd most furiously, and then turning to Loveit, said, — S'blood Coz, she's a well built Sloop, and will carry a huge deal of Cavas;

I'm afraid I shall never be able to run her fairly down.
WE had much of this Sort of Conversation, but Mr. Loveit came to the Point, and his giving me another Annuity of Thirty Pounds, I own it prejudiced me greatly in Favour of Captain Mizen. A few more Words finished this Affair, and I became the Property of this Man of War, and parted with my Friend with Love and Regret.
CAPTAIN Mizen visited constantly, but seldom before One or Two in the Morning, and frequently Half Seas over, as he called it. 'Twas difficult to manage him in this Trim; but when quite drunk, was very tame and obedient, so I took Care to ply him with Port or Punch, and then he turned in with Ease. In the Morning he always begged Pardon, not in Words, but in a pecuniary Manner, that carry'd irresistable Persuasion. I certainly hated him, and the Resistance I always made to his Caresses, served but to plague me the more with his Fondness. The Creature loved, and no Caliban could shew it more. I was his Pinnace, his Frigate, and a Thousand tender Names, but on struggling he has cry'd out'—"That's right!—Yard-arm

and Yard-arm.—S'blood Poll, an you blow me up, by the World I'll clap the broad R on you.
AT last my true Love went to Sea, and gave me a Reprieve for six Months. The Experience I had, made me find out the real Use of Money, and resolve to save as much as I could. The Captain returned with a fresh Cargo of that Commodity which his Love made less valuable. He was so generous, that I suffered his Embraces with great Freedom, but discovered the lucky Secret, that this was the only Chance I had of losing his valiant Heart. It seems he loved a smart Engagement, and a Ship that would take a good Deal of Drubbing before she struck. An easy Conquest was to him of no Value. With this Knowledge I pretended extreme Fondness; I hung on his Neck; I kiss'd his Carbuncled Cheeks, and almost cryed when he left me. He seemed pleased enough with my Behaviour, but his Visits were less frequent, and in six Months he forfeited his Articles, gave me the Good-bye, and left me like a Turtle all alone, to weep and mourn the Absence of her Mate.

MY Landlady, Mrs. Wheedle, was a Woman who understood the World. In

her younger Days she had been of personal Use to a Nobleman, who married her to his Footman, and procured him a very pretty Employ in the Revenue. Latterly, I believe, she served his Lordship in another Capacity. With these People I lived, and, all Things considered, was perfectly happy in the Friendship of Mrs. Wheedle. We went to Church, to Play-Houses, and were inseparable. In one of our Walks, I took it in my Head to enquire for my Old Friend near Grosvenor Square, of whom I had not heard for above six Years. Mrs. Wheedle went to the House, but found it inhabited by another Family. With some Difficulty I was informed, that the Old Gentleman's whole Fortune was swallowed up in the South Sea. That his Distress was so great, that it turned his Head, and had been supported by Charity in a Mad-house near Chelsea, where he died about a Year ago.—I had no great Reason to love his Memory, yet could I not help a few Tears, but guarded against calling his Fate a just Judgment.

LORD, said Mrs. Wheedle, what signifies it. If the Gentleman was a Friend in a Corner, thank God there be others in the World as good as he. Charity begins

at Home, my Dear, but nothing is to be got by Idleness. I love to see a young Woman Industrious and Careful. 'Tis the most recommendablest Thing in Life.'—'I am no Enemy, said I, to Industry, but sure you would not have me hawk about my Goods, or stand at the Door and cry,—Walk in Gentlemen! and behold the wonderful Works of Nature! Alive—Alive—ho!—"Certainly Polly, said she, you're distracted!—Did ever any Body hear such Nonsense?— If you will be industrious, I know a Friend will give you Employment." —Ay marry, said I, now you say something; but will he come down handsomely? for you know I hate a Game that can't afford paying the Cards.—"Lord, Lord, Polly, said she, you're strangely covetous! but I don't blame you neither. —There's 'Squire CARELESS now, the most Charmingest and most Agreeablest Man in Life, mayhap he may answer your Purpose.—What say to that, Polly?" —With all my Heart, said I, the Squire shall be welcome, but you know the Conditions.
IN a few Days Mr. Careless paid me a Visit, and, with great Ease and Familiarity, fell into a Chat of a Settlement,—

I'm so unlucky my Dear, said he, to have my Estate so fix'd by Law, that I cannot touch it. My Income I spend like a Gentleman. Pleasure is my Religion, and the Ladies are the Idols I adore. The Incense I burn is Money, and my Sacrifice is Love. Accept one and the other, and the Priestess below Stairs shall have Reason to be content." —I laugh'd at the Oddity of his Expressions, but as his Incense had a sweet-smelling Flavour, I was persuaded of the Sincerity of his Devotions, and I became his Titular Saint.

HIS Visits were very irregular, but, tho' always chearful, always good-humour'd and generous, they seemed rather paid to dispose of, and kill Time, than to see the Object of his Love.— Mrs. Wheedle took Notice of this, and insinuated, that vacant Hours might be employed to Advantage.—"There is Perquisites, said she, belonging to all Employments in Life, and since you keep an Office, I see no Reason why you shou'dn't have 'em as well as others."— If I keep an Office, said I, it is an Office of Assurance, or rather, that of an Underwriter; but where are the Perquisites you talk of? for I always admir'd your

Douceurs, or, as some call them, your Dowcers.—"You're a Mad-cap, said she, but let me alone to work for you,
THE good Woman was very skilful, and, at different Times, brought me acquainted with two or three elderly Gentlemen, who made ample Amends for the Roughness of their Beards, and their Stinking Breath. This Revenue was partly appropriated to my Friend's private Recreation and mine, and the Remainder to the Sinking Fund.
CARELESS sometimes met one of these Gentlemen in my Chamber, but seem'd quite indifferent about it. The Indolence of his Temper was such, that no jealous Thoughts had Power to give him Uneasiness. I once made an Apology for having a Stranger in my Apartment, and told him a well-contriv'd Lye.— "Bless me, Child, said he, why so many Words about a Trifle!—I know you are a Woman, and cannot help acting as such.— I know you have been playing the Truant, but why should I be angry at the constant Practice of your Sex? No, no, my Dear, I am so happy, that no Woman can disappoint me.—You have all the same Turn, and a little Cheating, even at Cards, affords you infinite Delight.

—The Pleasure of Deceiving has something exquisite in it, but I am so ill-natur'd as to disappoint you, and freely indulge a Passion so natural to the Ladies.
I OWN he flung me more by his Indifference, than had he storm'd and swore. I said what was necessary on the Occasion, but he took the Standish and wrote.— Here, my dear Polly, said he, are my Sentiments. Let's say no more on the Head, but love one another as well as we can."—He then began a very merry Conversation, and embracing me very tenderly, took his Leave.—I long'd to read his Paper, and found these Words;

The Easy Lover.
Why should I pretend to have
Dear POLLY's Heart entire?
What in her Power to me she gave,
And fann'd the am'rous Fire.


Then tell me not, ill-natur'd Soul!
To others she's as kind;
Why should I her Bliss controul,
Since others hit my Mind?



No; let us ramble, not repine,
Let both contented be;
Her Soul's her own, her Charms are mine,

And that's enough for me.

AT first I thought I had lost him for ever; but a Day or two convinc'd me to the contrary. We kept up a tender Correspondence for about a Twelve-month more; and my Perquisites regularly came in. At last his Extravagancies, and the Want of common Attention to his Affairs, drove him into such Difficulties, that he was compell'd to give up many Amusements, and Me amongst the rest.—Mrs. Wheedle's good Management prevented my too much regretting the Loss of Careless. She soon furnish'd me with another and another, and the last Fool still welcome as the first.

I MUST reserve for another Opportunity, my Travels to Ireland with a Lord of that Country, and to France with a Scotch Nobleman.—My living with a Jew, a Methodist Preacher, and sundry others; and the many Tricks I played in a Progress of fifteen Years, would make a large

Folio, and perhaps be as useful as MOLL FLANDERS.
IN a Word, I found myself possessed of about Two Hundred Pounds a Year well paid, besides some ready Money and Jewels.—Time began to gather my Roses, and ruffle my smooth Brow. The few Charms that remained, I resolved to use myself. I had seen the World, and found it a vain empty Nothing.—I began to call to my Memory the Days of Innocency and Happiness.—I reflected on the Charms of Religion and Virtue, for their Beauties had not quite forsaken me.— I try'd their Power, and they have conducted me to this Mansion of Peace and Tranquillity.
WHY are miserable Creatures call'd Women of Pleasure?—Poor Wretches! they know of none!—In their happiest Days, and in the highest Keeping, whom do they converse with?—In the Midst of Gaiety, they are in Darkness and Obscurity.—They walk with self-condemn'd and suspicious Looks, and just live like a Rat in the Wainscot.—When stript of their Finery, when discarded the fertile Paddock, and sent to graze on the Common. What Horrors!—What Vileness!

I DO not pretend to be a Judge of the Charms of Matrimony, neither can I have a just Idea of the Pleasure Parents take in their Children, as I never was in either Situation; but this I can positively affirm from my own Experience, that in the Midst of every Joy I was capable of receiving, as I certainly was of some, I had Reflections which I could not account for, but which gave me infinite Anxiety.—To be necessitated to be fond where I was quite indifferent.—To caress him whom I despised.—To seem to love, and be all Tenderness, where I hated, and even loath'd.—In short, to live, if I may so call it, a MARTYR to my Reason and Understanding, is a Situation the most deplorable human Nature can be reduced to.—As Light follow Shade, so Trouble and Remorse pursue the Vicious.—Who can fathom the Deep, or measure infinite Space! But Oh! who can describe the Joy, when the Father of infinite Mercy speaks Peace and Comfort to the contrite Heart!

She ceased.—Sangfroid prais'd the Steadiness of her Resolution, but Conyers was lost in Thought.—If, Madam, said he at last, your whole Life was shewn to the World, with the proper Observation of

a skilful Hand, how useful, how instructive would it be!—You would serve as a fix'd Star to direct the Unwary in the Voyage through Life; or, should Storms or Tempests drive them into Error, to guide and pilot them into an Harbour of Safety.—Vice has its Charms, but place Virtue in Contrast, How is it possible our Sense should stray?'—'Your Remark, Sir, said she, is just; but FRAILTY! thy Name is Woman, or rather, it is the common Name of all Mankind.—The whole World struggle and strive and fight for, what they call Happiness; but they neglect and despise the sure, the only Way of attaining it, which Religion and Virtue, free from Enthusiastick Cant, or Hypocritical Demureness, can alone point out.— The Remainder of the Conversation was very serious; but Night coming on, they were obliged, unwillingly, to separate.
As they returned, Conyers could speak of Nothing but Mrs. Cannon. He admir'd her good Sense, her easy Turn of Mind, and her Moral and Religious Sentiments; but thought she still led but a melancholy Life.—Quite otherwise, said Sangfroid, she has a sensible Servant for her constant Companion: She has her Books, her Musick, and her Garden; which give her a

rational Delight and Amusement: Besides, tho' her former Life is well known in the Village, her Sincerity and Virtue are so well vouch'd by her Conduct, that some of the best Families have lately visited her, and she them. She told me the other Day, that to keep Company, and be rank'd with modest Women, was such a Pleasure, as almost made her distracted.

THE HISTORY OF Jack Connor, now Conyers.


CHAP. I.


He parted frowning from me, as if Ruin
Leap'd from his Eyes.

SHAKESPEARE.




SOME few Days pass'd in the common Way, when Mr. Sangfroid entered, and with Pleasure told Conyers, he had provided him a good Place.— My Lord Bishop of —, said he, wants just such an one as you to transcribe his Works, and keep some Accounts.—Conyers, without Hesitation, accepted the Offer, and next Morning was

presented to the Bishop, and immediately entered on his Office.
HIS Lordship was a great Writer; but his Works were intended for the Use of Posterity, having never published but a Thanksgiving Sermon, and one on the 30th of January by Order of the House of Lords. His Tracts were very voluminous, but all essential, and of the utmost Consequence to Mankind. His Treatise on the Use and Abuse of Surplices and Lawn Sleeves was filled with the profoundest Erudition.— His Discourse on Pews, Cushions, and Mats, in Churches, was extremely well handled; but the Postscript on the Crime of sleeping in those Places, was so artfully worded, that you felt an Example in yourself. —His Letter to the Inhabitants of the Parish of — clearly demonstrated the Absurdity of a Steeple without Bells.—His Apology and Vindication of Murder, Adultery, and Fornication, proving, mathematically, that the Nature and Name of these Crimes were entirely changed by Circumstance, Time, and Place, was a most learned and elaborate Performance; but his favourite Work was his History and Doctrine of Tithes, which he demonstrated to be an Essential of True Religion.


HIS Lordship, at different Times, was so good as fully to explain these Subjects to Conyers, who in three Months had transcribed the Treatise on Surplices, and had just began the last-mentioned Work. He had full Employment, but was not extremely pleased with the Nature of it, for his Taste was so vitiated, that he found no Charms in what he did not understand.
THE Bishop kept a plentiful Table, where his Clergy were welcome, except the poorer Sort, to whom he made ample Amends for the Distinction by small Presents and large Promises. He was a Man of Virtue, and religiously kept his Word, when his Memory, which was none of the best, fail'd him not. So weak was he in that Quarter, that he remembered and forgot his Promise to a poor Curate ten different Times, and as often was angry with himself. On these Occasions he used to say, Well, God help me! I find I am grown old; my Faculties can't last for ever;— The Lord gave, and the Lord taketh away.
—Sometimes indeed his Memory was very sharp, for if one, or ten of his Clergy, were sick, he never failed a daily Enquiry after their Health; and when any died, he never suffered the Living to lapse. He could not bear Contradiction,

and no Doubt his Dependants were careful not to offend in that Article.—He did not like Money, but he passionately lov'd it.

JACK did not much approve of his Situation. He lived well, but he plainly saw he had no great Prospect of a future Fortune, and looked on himself as Gil Blas when with the Archbishop, which determined him to be soon convinced of what he had to depend on. He had Thoughts of writing a modest and moving Letter to his Lordship; but then he remembered, That 'a Verse may catch him, who a Sermon flies; so resolved to write a Stanza or two, and leave it on my Lord's Desk next Morning. Accordingly he sat down and wrote,


Tho' ev'ry Virtue fills my Heart,
Tho' Modesty o'er-spreads my Face,
What are their Worth, except some Art

Can raise these Virtues into Place.



Yet tho' I can't myself commend,

Kind Fate may still relieve my Want,
And, as dull Sermons always end,
Heaven of it's gracious Mercy grant!




MY LORD mounted to his Study as usual, and found the Scrowl, which he carefully read, and as carefully put into his Pocket.—Family Prayers and Breakfast being ended, Jack was ordered to attend him.— Good-morrow, Mr. Conyers, said his Lordship, I am extremely concerned that my Understanding did not discover your Worth and Genius before this Morning. They are so uncommon, they ought to be rewarded.—Jack applauded himself for his lucky Thought, but my Lord proceeded — I have a Paper in my Hand, on which you will permit my making a few Remarks. I believe it is intended for Poetry, which at the best, is an idle unprofitable Study; I shall not speak of the Rhime, but of the Subject. — Your first Line is false, for as you want Prudence, you cannot have every Virtue.—Your second is not Fact, for I never saw you blush in my Life.—Oh— I ask your Pardon, you blush now indeed.—As to the Worth of your Virtues and Modesty, I am afraid you will find it of little or no Value, and your Art must be extraordinary, if you think to impose on me. — But it seems you want a Place. — I shall soon put you into the High-road to Preferment.—Your Second Stanza

is most admirable. — You can't Praise yourself, poor Gentleman! although you tell us of your Virtue and Modesty.— This indeed is the Height of Modesty! Then, like a true Heathen, you believe in Fate. — If so, pray Mr. John take care of your Fate.—Here you complain bitterly of Want. Can any Man be said to want, who has three good Meals a Day?— Now comes the best of all.— You are one of those fine Gentlemen who can't play the Fool but they must bring in the Church. You abuse Sermons.— Who make Sermons but the Clergy?— and the Clergy make the Church. These Matters, Mr. John, ought to be held in Reverence by all Men, much more by such as you.'— 'I most humbly beseech your Lordship, said Jack, to —' 'Pray Sir, spare me, said my Lord, for I have but a few Words more to say.—You were so good as to give me a Bit of Poetry, and, in Return, permit me to give you a Bit of Prose.
—He then rung his Bell, and giving him a Paper proceeded.—Here is, Mr. John Conyers, some of my own Composition, and to shew you it is of some Value, pray tack these ten Guineas to it.—So now, Mr. John Conyers, you are a Free-Man, and have

my Consent to get what Place you please. —My Lord's Gentleman then entered the Chamber.—
Lewis, said my Lord, here is Mr. John, who has given me such a Lecture on his Modesty, that convinces me is the most impudent Fellow breathing: So, bid the Porter open the Door and let him out. Such Modesty ought to be seen in the World.—Jack was extremely mortified, and attempted to speak, but Lewis shoulder'd him out of the Room. Finding he could have no Remedy, he bundled up his little Effects, quitted the House, and soon visited Mr. Sangfroid, to whom he told his Story.

THIS Accident, said his Friend, gives me little Concern, for I believe his Lordship would never have provided for you as you deserve; but, if you will wear a Livery, I can get you into Sir Peter Shallow's Service To-morrow. He is a Member of Parliament, and perhaps, in Time, may procure you an Employment.'—'It is worth the Trial, said Conyers, and a Livery shall be no Objection.—Next Day Jack attended Sir Peter, and received the Badge of Office; but, by the Advice of his Friend, he took the Name of Constant.




CHAP. II.


There, Affectation, with a sickly Mein,
Shows in her Cheeks the Roses of Eighteen,
Practis'd to lisp, and hang the Head aside,
Faints into Airs and languishes with Pride,

On the rich Quilt sinks with becoming Woe,
Wrapt in a Gown, for sickness, and for show.
The Fair-ones feel such Maladies as these,
When each new Night-dress gives a new Disease.

POPE'S Rape of the Lock.


SIR PETER SHALLOW was a Gentleman of large Fortune, but more remarkable for his easy, quiet Temper, than strong Judgment. His Lady had somewhat of the opposite Character, and, as her Understanding informed her Sir Peter had but a small Share, she took the accustomed Priviledge of, sometimes, imposing on it, and indeed his great Fondness gave her frequent Opportunities.—Her Ladyship had a very delicate Constitution, and was afflicted with the Spleen and Vapours to such a Degree, that she has sometimes been silent for ten

Minutes, then has burst out into Lamentations and Tears, then into violent Laughter, and end in a Swoon.—Doctor Nostrum constantly attended; but one Evening when he had finished above, Sir John, got him to taste some Cape Wine, and give some Account of her Ladyship's Disorder. —Sir John, said the Doctor, who was a dry Joker, here is my Service to you.— Upon my Word very good Wine—very good Wine indeed, Sir. But—you were saying something of that there Disorder. —Why—to be sure, your Hypochondriac and Hysteric Disorders are troublesome,— very troublesome, and tedious, but seem, I may say, to be more so to the Husband or Wife, or Attendants, than to the Patient and Physician. I think I have had these Disorders, in a peculiar Manner under my Care, for these Thirty or Thirty-two Years last past; and I think I may say, that I understand them; that is, I know how to treat them properly.— There is no certain Rule to go by, for,— for as a skilful Mariner must find out the Trim of his Ship; so I say a skilful Physician must find out the Temper of his Patient. — If I prescribe a China Jarr, when the Malady is fix'd on a Japan Cabinet, I shall do Wrong,—be all out,

and perchance may double the Disorder upon me.


I OWN, Doctor, said Sir Peter, I am no Judge of these Matters, but for my Blood, I cannot conceive what Jarrs or Cabinets have to do in the Affair'—O Lord, Sir Peter, cry'd the Doctor — but here's my best Respects.—In Truth it has a charming Flavour!—but, as you were saying,—or—as I was saying.—To explain this Phoenomenon, I shall not call in the Ancients, for they were ignorant, very ignorant of sundry modern Ailments, but account, that is, Reason upon them, on the Principles of the modern Philosophy. — Hem — hem — The Disorder is of the Feminine Gender. — When it attacks a Masculine Figure, it then becomes of the doubtful.— It is termed, by Pre-eminence, Vapour, from its ascending Quality; for it rises (you'll please to observe, Sir) in the Heart by the too quick Viberation of the Blood, and mounts directly to the Brain.—Thus —when an Object is placed before a Lady in such a Point of Light, that the Rays of her Eyes center, and form a Focus upon it, the Effect is surprizing.— The Object indeed remains sound and entire, but her Heart burns for it.—

When the Heart Strings are untuned, no Wonder that the Voice is all Discord.— A Diamond Solitair—A Gilt Chariot—Fine Dresden China —An Indian Skreen — and the like, cause such a Fluttering of the animal Spirits, and raise such a longing for possessing them, that clearly demonstrates Sir Isaac's Doctrine of Attraction and Vision.—Contrary Principles will sometimes produce the same dreadful Effects—When a Lady delights in the innocent Amusement of PLAY, and has what they call, an ill Run, it undoubtedly will over-heat the Blood, and sour the Temper,— but I say—when she is not in a Condition to discharge such honourable Debts, the whole Mass is on a Ferment, and frequently produces Consequences very fatal to the Repose of the Family.


WOULD to Heaven, said Sir Peter, it was the Case of my dear Creature, I then could soon apply the Remedy.'—Why truly, Sir Peter, replyed the Doctor, two or three hundred Guineas make wonderful Alterations. I would advise you, Sir Peter, to see how my Prescriptions will operate for a Day or two.—If the Disorder don't take a Turn in that Time, why, apply your's.—But, here's

my good Lady's better Health.—I profess it is a most delicious Cordial! — It warms my Heart.' — 'I fancy, Doctor, said Sir Peter, this Wine would be very proper for my dear Girl.—It would raise her Spirits.—'Raise her Spirits, cryed the Doctor, why, it is their being too high that causes the Disorder.—Besides—Besides—All dulciferous Fluids are bad.— Acid is her proper Regimen, and tho' it is true, there is an Acidity in all Sweets; it is not of the right Sort—Your right genuine Sour, is the surest Remedy.—I have ordered the Juice of the Crab Apple to be taken internally, and the fungous Matter to be apply'd, Plaister-ways, to the Shoulders and Back, with great Success.—I was once sent for to a rich Carpenter's in Southwark, whose Wife was suddenly seiz'd with the Vapours.—The poor Woman was as extremely ill as any Lady of the first Quality.—So, Sir,—as I was saying,—I was going to order her the Apples, but the Season not affording any, and her Case being very desperate, I directed her Husband to take a slender Twig of that there Tree of about three Foot long, and apply the same in so smart a Manner to the Shoulders, that the Part might be thoroughly warmed,

and the Pores so opened, as at once to draw, and suffer the malignant Effluvia to evaporate with Ease.—Next Morning, Sir, I visited my Patient, but, to my very great Surprize, I found her chearfully sitting by the Kitchen Fire, darning her Husband's Stockings.—The Fellow was an ungrateful Dog — for he never employed me since.—I shall not, Sir Peter, take up more of your Time at present, but refer you to a small Folio on that Subject, which I have now ready for the Press,—This one Glass and no more.—Amongst a Variety of Observations, one is pretty general.—In all the Practice and Experience I have had, I never knew a Lady subject to Spleen or Vapours, who was bless'd with a surly ill-natur'd Husband.—In Russia the Disorder is unknown, otherwise the Great Klincosky, and the celebrated Baroniwisky, would have taken some Notice of it; but you frequently meet with the Use and Efficacy of the Crab Tree, and find it in most of their Prescriptions, which, perhaps, is given by way of Prevention.— But my Hour is come for a Consultation,—so—Sir Peter, your most obedient and most faithful humble Servant.—

POOR Sir Peter was greatly edified by the Doctor's learned Dissertation, but had not Judgment enough to take his Advice; for, with the Impatience of a Lover, he flew to my Lady's Apartment, and finding her somewhat composed, tho' extremely feeble, he ventured to mention, That perhaps she might want some little Necessaries he was unacquainted of, and intreated her Acceptance of Three Hundred Guineas. — He threw the Money on the Table; but it was astonishing to observe, how quickly the Remedy operated.—Her Face glowed, Vermillion spread her Cheeks, she smil'd heavenly, and, at last, most tenderly embracing her dear Sir Peter, she sunk into his Arms, and every Symptom of the Malady vanished.



CHAP. III.


For as a Pythagorean Soul
Runs thro' all Beasts, and Fish and Fowl,
And has a Smack of ev'ry one;
So Love does, and has ever done;
And therefore, tho' 'tis ne'er so fond,
Takes strangely to the Vagabond:
'Tis but an Ague that's reverst,
Whose hot-Fit takes the Patient first;
That after burns with Cold as much
As Ice in Greenland does the Touch.

HUDIBRAS.



THE Servants had persuaded Jack to be a Member, and pay Quarteridge to a Society of Footmen, which they called a Parliament. This Convocation regulated diverse weighty Matters, and raised a Fund for the Maintenance of their Brethren out of Place. The Members took the Titles of their respective Masters, and spoke and acted so near their Characters, that it might be termed a Saturnalia. Jack was but too punctual a Visiter. If he improved not in his Manners by such Company, he

thought, at least, that he was well diverted.
THE Constitution of this motly Synod, with their Conduct and Resolutions, must be postponed to another Chapter, that the Chain of this History may not be broken.
WAS our Hero intitled to an Estate, his Age would permit him to enjoy it.—His Complexion, his Manner, his Voice, but above all, his generous good-humoured Disposition, could not escape the piercing Eyes of Mrs. Susanna Pinup. This Lady acted in the humble Station of Waiting-Woman to Lady Shallow. From her Knowledge of sundry domestick Secrets, she had great Power in the Family, and, as the Servants phrase it, had feathered her Nest. Her great Sagacity not only discovered Charms in the Person of Mr. John Constant, but that he had Money likewise. The Union of such Perfections, merited her tenderest Regard, to which, she thought, if her own were added, the System of Happiness would be compleat.
WITH these Views Mrs. Pinup began to notice our Jack in a particular Manner. She shewed him every Civility; she honoured him frequently with her Conversation, and was so intimate and gracious, that he often drank Tea in her Chamber.

Such a manifest Partiality drew on her the Resentment and scandalous Tongues of the other Servants; but, from her exalted Seat, she looked down with Contempt on the vulgar Wretches.—Mr. Buffett, the Butler, seemed most concerned, and, with a jaundic'd Eye, beheld this growing Passion, so fatal to his Hopes. This Gentleman had long sighed for Mrs. Pinup, and made sundry Libations of Pints of Sack, and other choice Wines, on the Shrine of her Beauty. His Project was as extensive as it was ambitious. He judged, that could he obtain the Heart of this Lady, the cheating the Family in every Branch, from the Cellar, upwards, would centre in his own Pocket. This was a Loss his Philosophy was not Proof against, and made him meditate dire Revenge.
Mrs. PINUP was so fond of Jack, and so secure of her darling Scheme, that she omitted some Essentials in bringing it to bear; for one Evening, when Protestations and Vows were plentifully bestowed on each other, and fervent Kisses and Embraces given, and returned with mutual Ardour, the World and all its idle Ceremonies, were forgotten, and equal Happiness cemented their Hearts without the Assistance of any Priest, except that of Love.

MATTERS were thus conducted for some Time; but Mrs. Pinup had praised Jack so much to Miss Shallow, that she longed to converse with him, and Pinup's Chamber gave her frequent Opportunities. Miss Shallow was Sister to Sir Peter, and had a Fortune of Ten Thousand Pounds. Her Education had been none of the best, and her Person was of that Sort, that a Man passes by without noticing. However, Jack's Vanity was strangely up, and Ten Thousand Pounds put a Million of Schemes into his Head, and his waking and sleeping Dreams were filled with Equipage and Splendor.—With some Difficulty and weighty Reasons, he persuaded Pinup to assist him, and Miss Shallow seemed no-ways averse to his Caresses and Proposal, tho' the was actually engaged to 'Squire Hunt, and the Marriage Writings drawn. In short, nothing was wanting to compleat this Affair but a convenient Opportunity, which would soon have happened, had not adverse Fate, in the Shape of Mr. Buffett, maliciously interpos'd.
JEALOUSY, Envy, Interest and Revenge, are powerful separate, but make strange Havock when united. Buffett had them all. He had never ceas'd watching the Motions of Mrs. Pinup; and his Discoveries

were such, that they added to his Pain; but, when he found Miss Shallow was of the Party, Revenge opened an ample Field.
SIR Peter, as I've before observed, was not the brightest Genius in England; but, in Recompence, Nature had indulged him with a large Share of Pride, (that Vice of little Minds!) with which he sometimes imposed himself on the World as a Man of Consequence and great Importance.— Mr. Buffett knew his ruling Passion, and applied to it. On the first Notice, the Knight stormed and swelled with Rage; but the Butler moderated his Anger, and persuaded him into Patience, until he should convince him of the Truth.—Next Evening the Lovers met; but the artful Buffett had so contrived, that Sir Peter abruptly entered, and caught the unguarded Pair in their innocent Embraces, and Mrs. Pinup in the Midst of a Discourse on Constancy.—Fine Doings in my House, cryed Sir Peter, — But I'll spoil your Sport, you impudent Son of a W—re.— He ran directly at Jack, but Love and Miss Shallow averted the Blow, and gave him an Opportunity of slipping out of the Room. His Retreat was so precipitate, that he did not observe the Butler list'ning

on the Stair-head, but drove against his Breast with such Force, that poor Mr. Buffett was hurried down a little improperly, for his Head went foremost. He fell with a mighty Noise, and the Alarm was general through the Family. — Had there been Earth or Air-quakes in those Days, no Doubt they had all ran to Prayers, and laughed at themselves for so doing, when the Danger was over.—Sir Peter thundered —Miss screamed, and Pinup wept so loud, that my Lady with her Company, and almost all the Servants, filled the Room in an Instant.
THE Knight thought he acted very cunningly, by not telling the Whole of this Affair before so many; but as he dropt some Words about Miss, and insisted that Pinup and Jack should be immediately discharged, he left them all Room enough to think the worst, tho', perhaps, their Charity and Good-nature wanted not his Help.—My Lady pleaded strongly for poor Pinup; yet at last she was obliged to consent, but with a Proviso, that the Butler should make a Third. Sir Peter gave him up very readily, so that in less than an Hour, the ill-fated Mr. Buffett lost his Cellar.—The unhappy Pinup lost all her Lover's Promises.—The unfortunate Jack

lost Ten Thousand Pounds, and — next Day Miss Shallow lost her Reputation, but luckily she found it on the Third, in the Arms of 'Squire Hunt.

I FORGOT to mention, that Mr. Sangfroid had been lately obliged to accompany a Nobleman to Lisbon; so that Jack lost this Asylum, with his Advice and Friendship.—When he had packed up his Goods, and resigned his Livery, he found Mrs. Pinup waiting for him in the Hall, because, as she said, One Coach might serve both. — They mounted, but where to drive was not determined; but at last they stopt in Southampton-street. Jack alighted, and soon found a convenient Lodging, where the happy Pair acted the Part of Man and Wife, with great Harmony for about a Fortnight. Pinup often boasted her Riches, and tempted him, by shewing Thirty Guineas in hard Gold, besides Linens and Woollens, and sundry Gowns and Petticoats.— 
Jack was Proof against all Tears and Intreaties. — 'Psha, said he, I've more than that myself. Marry! — we should be pretty Devils truly! No, no, Child, keep your Money, and I'll keep your Secret.'—'I don't understand, said she, what you mean by Secrets. — If I have any, I believe it won't be a Secret

long.—I wish your Money was no more a Secret than mine.'—'So much for Secrets, reply'd Jack, now for the Proof. Do you see that large Trunk, my Dear? 'Tis the faithful Repository of fifty Guineas.' Ay, ay, said she, I see both your Trunks, but for the Money, seeing's believing.' 'You have no more Faith, cry'd Jack, than an Ebrew Jew; but I shall convince you in a Moment.—The large Trunk had not been open'd, by him, these six Months, and he found the Lock rusty, and more difficult than it used to be. At last he got the better, but was surprized at seeing some of his Effects out of order. In a little Flutter, he search'd for his Purse, but not readily finding it, his Hurry increased, and he pull'd out an old Great Coat, and some tatter'd Shirts artfully mingl'd with some of his Things of little Value.—In a Word, his Money and his best Effects were vanish'd. — He flew in an Instant to the small Trunk, which contain'd his ordinary wear, and in which he had very oddly placed the small Box his old Friend Mr. Kindly had given him, and most of Mr. Villeneuf's and his own Papers. Finding this safe and untouch'd, he sat down in Silence, tho' greatly perplex'd.


BLESS me, said Mrs. Pinup, what ails the Man?—Sure, you haven't lost your Money? — Yes, said Jack, 'tis gone, — every Shilling gone! but how, or which Way, Heaven knows!—Heaven knows! said she, I believe Heaven knows very well you had no such Thing, but that you've betray'd and cheated a poor innocent Woman; but since I find these are your Tricks, I shall take Care of myself, I assure you.—Very well, reply'd Jack, pray proceed, for I am in a Temper to provoke a Saint; for I sha'n't answer.—As she had nothing to fear, she saluted him with bitter Terms, and many stinging Reproaches, till Tears interven'd, and gave him a Recess.— Since, said he, you are so good to be silent, because you have no more to say, pray let me be heard.—I have my Quarter's Wages in my Pocket, which will more than pay the Lodging. Let me have a little Repose this Night, and To-morrow you may dispose of yourself how and which way you please, for, by the Lord, this shall be the last. — Pinup attempted a Reply, but he swore in so peremptory a Manner, as frighten'd the poor Woman into Silence. They retir'd to Bed, but Love and Repose had forsaken it, and Hatred and Disquietude took their

Place. The dawning Day rous'd Jack from his Pillow, and Pinup unwillingly follow'd. He generously paid all Charges, and putting his Trunks on a Bier, parted with this Lady, telling her, before the Land-lady, that she might follow at her Leisure, but, as he intended, so, he never saw her after.


CHAP. IV.



EXAMPLE is a living Law, whose Sway
Men more than all the written Laws obey.

SEDLEY.



AS the dropping Water will, in Time, impress even Marble, so low and mean Company will communicate their Sentiments and infect even an Heart of Understanding and Virtue. Jack now ceas'd to be the agreeable and the polite. He swore much, and sometimes drank. He had contracted a saucy impertinent Air, and instead of that humble, modest Deportment that drew on him the Love and Esteem of the World, his Looks and Actions seem'd to demand them as his Right, and as due to his Person and superior Merit.

He forgot all the Lessons and Instructions of his Friends, and thought his own Experience and great Knowledge were sufficient to conduct him, without the Assistance of pedantick Rules, or the musty Gravity of old Philosophers.
HOWEVER, this last Stroke of Fortune had alter'd his Thermometer, and Pride sunk down to extreme Humility. In this Temper he apply'd to Mr. Edge, a Barber, to whom he made known his Situation. Honest Edge was sorry to find him in such Distress, and provided him a Room for two Shillings a Week, but for his Diet, he was to manage the best Way he could. He had still three Guineas and some Silver remaining, and waited, with great Anxiety, for a Turn of Fortune.
AS our Hero, like other Heroes, has found a Time for Idleness and Inaction, it furnishes me an Opportunity of examining the Memoirs of the Parliament of Footmen, and making such Extracts as I judge of publick Use and Benefit.
THIS noble Order held their Assemblies at sundry Beer-Houses, but all united in the main View of giving Laws to, and providing a Maintenance for the Brethren who came within their Rules. The Chamber our Friend frequented was fill'd with

the Servants of Dukes, Lords, Bishops, Knights and Squires, and made up a subscribing Body of about two hundred, of which forty or fifty were commonly present at each weekly Assembly. As these great Men, follow'd the Example of their great Superiors, they were less clamorous than might be expected. An old Gentleman fill'd the Chair as Speaker, and kept Matters in most excellent order.
THE following are a few of their principal Resolutions; for by the Advice of Friends, I shall speedily publish, by Subscription, a full and impartial History of this noble Order, in seven Volumes Octavo, in which will be included all their Speeches on the most interesting Subjects, and a complete System of Wisdom and Prudence. The Resolutions necessary in this Place are as follow.
RESOLVED, That each Member, when out of Place, shall receive two Shillings each Week, for the Term of six Months, but no longer. On his getting a new Livery to pay fresh Entrance.
RESOLVED, That each Member pay five Shillings on his Admittance, and two Shillings and Sixpence each Quarter.
RESOLVED, That no Member, when accompanying his Master or Mistress in

their Visits, shall attempt to open or hold the Coach Door, or afford them any the least Assistance, but leave them to the Care of the Servants of the Family visited.
RESOLVED, That the Hats, Swords or Canes of Gentlemen visiting our respective Masters, shall be seized upon, and kept in safe Custody, until the said Gentlemen depart. Should any of the said Gentlemen refuse or neglect to pay the usual Compliment, it shall and may be lawful to change his said Hat, &amp;c. or have them mislaid or lost, and, as Occasion serves, to give him Water when he calls for Wine; small Beer when he desires Bread; and, if he be an obstinate Offender, entirely to disregard and affront him.
RESOLVED, That as we look on the Tables of our Masters as Ordinaries, so we expect to be paid in Proportion to their Rank, from half a Crown to half a Guinea.
RESOLVED, That no Persons paying a Morning Visit to our respective Masters, and particularly Trades-People with Bills, shall be permitted to see them, except on Payment of the usual and accustomed Fee, but on their Compliance, then our said Masters to be made visible, notwithstanding any Orders to the contrary.

RESOLVED, That all Tradesmen shall be obliged to pay at the Rate of Five Pounds by the Hundred, for every Commodity sold to our respective Masters; and the said Tradesmen are hereby empower'd to make an extraordinary Charge of ten Pounds by the Hundred.
RESOLVED, That in attending our Masters or Mistresses to the Play-house, or any other publick Spectacle where we are admitted, we will endeavour to imitate their Conduct, by doing our utmost to disturb the Audience. This will demonstrate our Power, and shew the Use of exalting us.
RESOLVED, That no Member shall be entitled to the Benefit of this Society, who shall live more than three Months in any Family who do not play Cards five Nights in the Week, Sunday Night included; neither shall he receive any Benefit, if it can be proved that he has suffer'd any Diminution to his Authority and legal Privileges.
RESOLVED, And it is hereby most solemnly agreed, by the Honour and Dignity of our Cloth, that should any Member of this Society marry the Relict of his Master, or the Daughter of his Master or Mistress, that he shall pay into the Hands of our Treasurer, Ten Shillings for every

Hundred Pounds obtained by such Marriage.
RESOLVED, That any Member, guilty of Robbery or Theft, shall be expell'd this Society. Nevertheless, this is not understood to extend to Breach of Trust, Embezzlement of Goods, and the necessary Frauds in Bread, Coals, Candles, Oats, &amp;c. which we regard as Privileges annexed to our Posts, and Part of our just Perquisites.

RESOLVED, That each Member be as careful as possible of all his Apparel, except the Livery, and that he practises all lawful Ways and Means to wear out his Master's Shirts, Shoes, Stockings, &amp;c.
THEY had many more, equally wholesome Laws, not made, like some others, to be broken or despised, for I apprehend they kept strictly to each.



CHAP. V.


Endure and conquer; Jove will soon dispose
To future Good our past and present Woes:
An Hour will come with Pleasure to relate
Your Sorrows past, as Benefits of Fate.

DRYDEN'S VIRGIL.




JACK remain'd at the Barber's about three Weeks; and tho' he received his Parliamentary Pension very punctually, yet his Money diminished apace.
HE saw no Appearance of Advancement, and gloomy melancholy Thoughts rack'd his Brain. With a View of alleviating his Sorrows, he frequently took a Dram, and innocently amused himself with one or two very low Amours. This made his Purse feel a very sensible Decay, for it now contain'd but a very few Shillings.— Mad and wild at the Cruelty of his Fate, a thousand Projects fill'd his Head, and at last ended in the noble Resolution of spending the Little he had in Pleasure, and then to resign a Life that became burthensome to him. He brought many weighty Reasons to vindicate the Action, and call'd, to

his Mind the Example of sundry great Men who accounted it meritorious. — Why are we, said he, brought into the World but to enjoy the few Pleasures of it with Ease and Content.—What Ease have I? —What Content?—If the Reasons of Being cease, it is but just we should cease to Be—Besides, What are all the Pleasures of this World, even in the highest Gratification, but idle stupid Repetitions of the same stupid Amusements? —Come, gentle Thames, and peaceful Grave now come, for Conyers is aweary of this World, and longs to lay his troubled Head in Dust!


HE was now in St. James's Park. His Steps were slow; his Arms were folded; his Head reclined, and a fix'd Melancholy was seated on his Brow.—In the Midst of these Reflections, two of his quondam Brethren pass'd him by; but one, turning about, cry'd,— Z—ns, Jack Constant!— Such a Man alive! Where the Devil have you hid yourself these thousand Years?—These Sort of Greetings finished, they enter'd into Particulars. I suppose, said Tom Smart, you are now one of those poor dastardly Scoundrels, who starve in a rich World.'— 'Let him starve, cry'd Jack Brazen, if he han't Spirit enough

to fish in troubled Waters.' 'Come, come, said Smart, d'ye really want Money?'— 'Not much, reply'd our Friend, for I believe I have a Shilling; but where to get another, the Lord knows.' — 'Here's a Guinea, my Boy, said Smart, you see I don't want Money, nor need you, if you'll take our Advice; but let's dine together, and talk that Matter over.

THEY dined, and a Bottle of Port was open'd, as well as the Conversation. Smart dwelt long on the partial Distribution of the good Things of this World, and on the Necessity of correcting the Scheme.— Is it just, said he, that Numbers of good-for-nothing worthless Animals shall wallow in Plenty and Abundance, whilst such young Fellows as us may want the common Conveniencies of Life?'—Very just, said Brazen, provided they will permit our using some of their Superfluities.'— D—me, said Jack, but I am all in the Dark. I wish you'd speak a little plainer, or not speak at all. You may depend on my Secrecy, for I am almost already in the Grave. Now, Gentlemen, if you've a Mind to bring me to Life, come to the Point directly, and a thousand to one but I'll join in your Scheme.' — 'Well

said, honest Jack, cry'd Smart, then to the Point.—You must know, that Brazen and I were turn'd a-drift together from my Lord's. We wore out our Shoes and the Pavement, but could get no Employment; and something told us, that Eating was necessary, so, my dear Constant, we padded it about the Fields for some Time, and, by our Industry, have risen to Horse. We are at this Time Commissioners of the Highways, and collect those Duties omitted in the Acts of Parliament.'— 'I understand you, said Jack; but does it answer? Is it not dangerous?' — 'It answers, said Smart, extremely well, tho', to be sure, it is a little hazardous; but where is the Employment without it? — Don't the Merchant venture for Lucre, and the Soldier and Sailor risk their Lives for Six-pence a Day?— Some risk their Reputation, and most People risk their Souls. — Believe me, Jack, the whole World is a Game of Hazard, and (shewing his Pistols) here are my Dice.—Will you set?

OUR Hero paus'd, and a violent Conflict arose in his Breast between Virtue and Necessity.—At last, Brazen clapp'd him on the Shoulder, and cry'd, — What says my dear Boy?—Will you make a Third,

and then our Party is compleat?— Gentlemen, said Jack, give me your Hands. Now I am a Brother. — Command and lead me where you please.

That Night they conducted him to their Lodging, and gave him a Horse for the Morning Expedition, and three Guineas more. They rose very early, and Jack put on a Pair of Spatterdashes, examin'd his Saddle and Pistols, and found all Things in tolerable Order.
THE Plan of Operation was settled by Smart, but, providentially, Jack made a small Alteration. No, Gentlemen, said he, let us not set out together, or keep Company on the Road, as it may cause Suspicion; let us rather divide, and ride on to Staines, but join on Hounslow-heath precisely at Eleven o'Clock, when we can't fail of meeting the Coach we look for. — Besides, when separate, we may each pick up a single Traveller to amuse us before the principal Action.'—'Very right, said Smart, then I'll advance first, Brazen will follow in half an Hour, and you will bring up the Rear in another; so, Gentlemen, Good-morrow, Success attend us.—He rode off, and Brazen but rested his proper Time.

WHEN alone, Jack began to consider this Affair more circumspectly, but not with a Design of breaking his Engagement. The Fellow, who took Care of the Horses, was no Stranger to the Expedition, and congratulated his new Master, on the Prospect of making his Fortune. 
Tim, said Jack, I have a Thought that will surprize my Friends; if you will assist me I'll give your a Crown for your Trouble.' —That I will, Master, answer'd Tim, and be true and faithful too.'— 'Well, then, said Jack, take my Horse, and ride a little beyond the Church at Hounslow, and wait for me; you may depend I shan't keep you long. When you deliver me the Horse, go directly across the Heath. — Tim promis'd to obey his Orders, and set forwards.
TWO odd Circumstances happen'd to Jack. He very fortunately knew the Name of a Family that liv'd just by Hounslow, of which he intended to make a proper Use; and the Old Great Coat which he found in his Trunk, he had made into a Surtout, and was then on his Back. This Coat was of that Sort of Cloath that is one Side Scarlet, and the other Blue; it was single, and not lined. This Day the Blue was outside, and the Sleeves turn'd up,

made Scarlet Cuffs. Thus dress'd, he walk'd to Piccadilly, and took a Post-Chaise to Hounslow, where he arrived at Ten o'Clock. With great Civility he enquired of Mrs. Day about the Family he said he was going to visit. He call'd for a Gill of Wine, and the good Woman answer'd all his Questions, which were such, as made her imagine he was a Relation of the Family, and had just come from Abroad. He hinted, that perhaps he might stay there a Week, or return in an Hour, when he'd be glad of a Post-Chaise ready for London. Mrs. Day assuring him he should have one at a Moment's Warning, he walk'd forward tho' with a troubled Mind, and soon found his Horse. When Tim had march'd off, he turn'd his Surtout, and was now in Scarlet, with Blue Sleeves.
HE rode on about three Miles, and met with his Friends, who began to be in some Pain about him.

Z—ds, said Smart, what the Devil kept you so long?—but we have no Time to talk, for the Coach is at Hand. You are to keep the Postillion and Coachman in Awe; Brazen will do the same with the Servants, and let me alone for conversing with the Passengers. When the Jobb's over, let's separate, and meet at our Lodging.


THEY had no Time for further Deliberation, for the Coach drew near.— Courage! cry'd Smart, and all rode briskly forward.—Jack did his Duty with the Postillion;—The Servants, making a Resistance, received a Fire from Brazen, which did no Harm; but the Compliment was instantly return'd, and poor Brazen fell from his Horse. Whilst this was doing, Smart attack'd the Coach, but a Gentleman in it, with great Resolution, so nimbly, and with such Strength, turn'd his Wrist, that the Pistol went off in the Air, and immediately one of the Servants rode up, and knock'd him down.
JACK, finding two Wings of his Army taken Prisoners, was determin'd to save the Remainder by a speedy Flight. The Gentlemen and Servants were so busy about Smart and Brazen, that he was not pursu'd, but got near Hounslow in a short Time.— His former Caution had now its Use; for tying his Horse to a Tree, a little out of the Road, he once more turn'd his Coat, and walk'd leisurely on to the Inn. With a tolerable Coolness of Temper, he desir'd a Post-Chaise; but accidentally a Horse was wanting, which obliged him to wait a full half Hour, which, no doubt, he thought was half an Age. He summon'd

all his Resolution to avoid Suspicion, and talk'd to Mrs. Day about the Family he had visited. His Chaise was just ready when Mr. Day enter'd.—There, now, said he, is two fine Gentlemen that have made a noble Kettle of Fish of it this Morning.' — 'Bless me, my Dear, said Mrs. Day, what's the Matter? — Not much, reply'd her Husband, only a Coach was stopp'd on the Heath by three High-waymen, and two of 'em is taken, and now at next Inn.'—'Dear Sirs, said Mrs. Day, 'tis the most preposteroustest Thing in Life, that Gentlefolks won't travel in Post Chaiseses, and then they're always safe from these Fellows.'—'Well, well, said her Husband, I must send after the Third who escap'd; I'll engage to find out his Scarlet Coat before Night.'— Were it not, said Mrs. Day, that these poor Creatures pay for being Taken, I am sure and certain my Husband would never trouble his Head about them; because, you know, Sir, one of the Gang will peach, and then the others hang of Course.

WHAT were the Emotions of Jack's Soul, cannot be express'd. He felt Agonies that all his former Distresses had never plung'd him into; but, recollecting his

Situation, he chim'd in with Mrs. Day, and spoke greatly against the Disturbers of the Publick.—At last, he took his Leave of Mrs. Day, mounted his Chaise, and got safe to London, but often thought the Horses were very bad.


CHAP. VI.


To he Good, is to be Happy: Angels
Are happier than Men, because they're better.
Guilt is the Source of Sorrow; 'tis the Fiend,
Th' avenging Fiend, that follows us behind
With Whips and Stings. The Bless'd know none of this,
But rest in everlasting Peace of Mind,
And find the Height of all their Heav'n in Goodness.

ROWE.



GUILT is a Fiend, that seizing the Conscience, becomes a Tyrant over every Idea of Man. Remorse is his Companion, and Suspicion and Fear constantly pursue his Steps. Disquietude engrosses every Thought, and even his sleeping Imagination is fill'd with Dread and Horror. —Our poor Hero is now an Object of the greatest Compassion.—He knew not whom

to trust, where to fly for Safety, or how to live; and he had now discover'd that he was very unfit to die.—He got to his Lodging, and telling the Barber that he was engaged to a Gentleman at Hampstead, he paid a Week's Rent, call'd a Coach, and drove, with his Effects, to an Inn in South-wark.

NOT secure in so publick a Place, he found out a poor Widow in a neighbouring Village, with whom he agreed for Diet and Lodging. Here he was safe and quiet, had his anxious Thoughts permitted him any Repose. A Fortnight pass'd, and he paid the poor Woman very punctually. She began to conceive a very great Opinion of Mr. Conyers, as his whole Deportment was very regular and decent. His Mind now grew somewhat more calm, and his Sleep was less disturb'd, for he most sincerely repented of his Folly and Wickedness, and with great Fervency and Devotion, confess'd his manifold Transgressions, and humbly pray'd for Mercy and Forgiveness.

HIS Purse was extremely low. He had Thoughts of applying to some People he knew, but durst not venture to London; and his Landlady was so poor, she could not afford to give him Credit.—He almost

determin'd to break his Promise to Mr. Johnston, and write to Lord Truegood, or Mr. Kindly; but as he knew not what Apology to make for deferring it so long, or how to account for his Conduct, he was obliged to lay the Thought aside, at least for the present.—He frequently wept most bitterly, and bewail'd his wretched Condition. The Agitation of his Mind affected his Health, and threw him into a dangerous Fever. The poor Woman was extremely tender and careful of him, but his Soul wanting as salutary Remedies as his Body, he begg'd that a Clergyman might be sent for; and Doctor St. Amour, Minister of the Parish, attended on the first Notice. This Gentleman was one of those who reproach many of his Profession, for he was pious without Moroseness, and charitable without Ostentation. Jack, tho' extremely weak, politely thank'd the Doctor for his Condescension in visiting so poor, so wretched, so miserable a Being. — The good Man, with an easy Countenance, reply'd.—If your Situation, Sir, is so bad, I think you require, and have a natural Right to my more immediate and particular Attention.


THE Doctor pray'd by him in the true Spirit of Devotion. His Exhortations

were so fill'd with Christian Eloquence, as warm'd and chear'd the Heart of Conyers, and insensibly lighten'd his Burthens.— The Fever still continued, and the Doctor never fail'd his Morning and Evening Visits.— Jack was so charm'd, that he open'd his whole Soul to this good Man, and hid not the minutest Part of all his Affairs since his Return from France.—The Gentleman flatter'd not his Sins, neither did he attempt to affright him with the dismal Prospect of endless Misery. He skilfully probed and cleansed his Wounds, and then pour'd in the Balsam of Peace, Comfort, and Hopes of Pardon by Repentance, and a Newness of Life.—Had Mr. Dryden been acquainted with one Man of Dr. St. Amour's Character, I apprehend he would not have said, that Religion and Roguery go together.

IN one of these Conversations, Jack took an Opportunity of mentioning the Promise he made to Mr. Kindly when he gave him the small Box, as spoken of in a former Chapter. — I am now, Sir, said he, so poor, so indigent, that I think I may safely open the Present; but I am so feeble, that I must beg your Assistance. The Doctor found the Box in the Trunk, and open'd it by the Bed-side.—He pull'd out a Quantity of Straw, and, at last, a

Sheet of Paper which he read, and contained these Words.



My Dear Jack,

Bounty Hall,

1732.



IF you have kept your Promise with regard to this Box, you must certainly be miserable when you read this. I have a sincere and most affectionate Regard for you, and weep at the Situation I must suppose you are in.
Should the Will of the Almighty afflict you with Sickness or Misfortunes, patiently resign yourself into his Hands, who alone knows your Necessities, and who suffers not a Sparrow to fall to the Ground without his Orders. Wait his good Time without repining, and firmly rely on his Bounty.
But, should your Calamities spring from Wickedness, Folly, and Extravagance. Oh my Child! turn to the Father of Mercies, and with a pure and upright Heart confess your Crimes; repent of your Faults, read his Word, and practise his Divine Precept. You will then know the Blessing of Righteousness, the Joys of Virtue, and the real Felicity of conscious Innocence. But, be not good only for a Time; Beware of relapsing into mistaken Pleasures. Ruin

and Reprobacy will follow, and Soul and Body be at Stake.
Oh Jack! If your Heart be not harden'd in Iniquity: If any Spark remains of a virtuous Education: If Gratitude be not dead in your Breast, think, ere it is too late. Think on your own Happiness, and think on your assured Friend,

JOHN KINDLY.



POSTSCRIPT. Under this Paper you will find a Proof of my Love.



AS the Doctor read, Jack wept. The good Man could not avoid sympathizing, and with streaming Eyes, pursued the Directions of the Postscript; but when he open'd a Paper nicely roll'd, and threw Twenty Guineas on the Table, poor Jack attempted to speak, but his Tongue faultering, he fainted on his Pillow. With some Difficulty he recover'd, and a violent Fit of Crying ensu'd.—Yes, cry'd he, I will obey my Father, my Friend, and my Guardian Angel! Oh Sir! What has not this most worthy Man done for me! — He saved me when an Infant, and preserves me when a Man. Good God! Can I be ungrateful to his Hopes?—Can

I disregard his charitable Instructions?— No! If Heaven prolongs my Days, they shall be employ'd in Virtue and Honour.' Your Resolution, said Dr. St. Amour, is truly just, and I pray God to keep you firm in it, but this present Mark of his Bounty, is not the only one you have lately received.—His Providence has preserv'd you from the shameful, infamous Death that your Hounslow Companions suffer'd last Week. I have enquir'd particularly into that Affair, and find you have nothing to dread. A third Person was indeed spoken of at the Tryal, but the Name of Constant or Conyers was never mention'd. Let this suffice to ease your Mind.—Follow Mr. Kindly's Advice, and be happy!

WHEN alone, he shudder'd and wept at the Fate of Smart and Brazen. He reflected on the dreadful Consequences of lawless Pursuits. He traced back his own Life and wicked Conduct, and found, that one Vice generates another; that as they grow in Strength; they corrupt the Heart by Degrees, until the whole Man is swallow'd up in Debauchery, and his Name and Nature eraz'd out of the Volume of the World. —How fatal, continued he, is the Beginning of Evil! and who can foresee the

End?—We go on from Step to Step regardless of Danger. We walk on Fire cover'd with Ashes. No Thought, no Prudence guides. We dream of Pleasure and Delight, but, too often, awake in the Gulph of Sorrow and Perdition! — How few, like me, have prov'd an almost miraculous Escape, and what Thanks, what Gratitude do I not owe for my Deliverance!—His Reflections were very just and moving, and he promis'd to himself an entire Change of Conduct.
HIS Spirits began to revive, and in a few Days the Fever left him. He thank'd the Apothecary, and desir'd his Bill, but the good Doctor St. Amour had been beforehand with him. So generous was this Gentleman, that he would not permit him to mention that, or any other Obligation he lay under.—All I now want, said the Doctor, is to see you quite recovered, and then we shall think of somewhat for your Service.— In a Week he was perfectly well, tho' a little Pale, and when neatly dress'd, the Doctor was surpris'd at his comely Appearance.—At last he propos'd an Employment to Jack, which, he said, he knew he could discharge extremely well. —
Sir John Curious, continued he, wants a young Man, like you, to read to him,

and keep his private Accounts. I have satisfied him as to your Abilities, and he is willing to give you thirty Pounds a Year. He is very old, rich and gouty, and sometimes peevish, but a Man must bear with the Infirmities of Superiors. He then proceeded in a very useful Lecture on a moral and political Conduct.—Conyers return'd him many Acknowledgements, and in two Days he took a grateful Adieu of the good Widow, and fix'd in London with the Family of Sir John Curious.



CHAP. VII.


You cannot Love, nor Pleasure take or give;
But Life begin, when 'tis too late to live:
On a tir'd Courser you pursue Delight;
Let slip your Morning, and set out at Night.

DRYDEN.



NEVER Man began an Employment with more Pleasure. He seem'd as if return'd again into Life, and was determin'd to spare no Pains in enjoying it.— His first Care was a particular Attention to his Duty, and his next was to find out the

Family Oeconomy, that he might adapt himself to their different Tempers.
SIR JOHN CURIOUS was Sixty-seven Years of Age, very corpulent, and extremely infirm. When his Gout was not violent, he din'd with his Company, and was very chearful. From Seven to Nine at Night, Jack read to him; at Ten he went to Bed, but never rose till about Eleven next Morning. Two Servants attended him, and about One o'Clock, all his Flannels were remov'd, and in an old embroider'd Coat and great Wig, he sat in his Arm-Chair, and Jack did the Duty of his Office till Three o'Clock.—He did SIR ROBERT WALPOLE the Honour of being his Enemy, and look'd on the Craftsman, equal, if not superior to Holy Writ, consequently these Papers were every Moment quoted. In this Choice of Books he had great Judgment, and to shew it fully, he delighted in the Works of TAYLOR the Water Poet; in an old and only Translation of DUBARTUS; in huge Folios of Heraldry; and when inclin'd to Sleep, in the modern Pamphlets and weekly Papers.
HIS House-Steward had a good Salary, and a certain Quarterly Sum for providing all Things for the Family. This Sum was accounted for, but could not be exceeded.

To examine, and checque these Accounts, was part of Jack's Duty.
SIR JOHN had always maintain'd the Character of A fine Gentleman. His Dress was gay, and his Manner such, that supported the Dignity he assum'd. It was a Question, whether Pride or Avarice had the Superiority in his Constitution, but it is certain, they frequently acted in concert. Pride obliged him to a Punctuality in paying his Debts, but Avarice prevented his going a Step beyond it.—Pride made him extremely Courteous, Complaisant and Ceremonious, because he lov'd to be so treated himself, but Avarice stopp'd his Ears against the Cries of the Poor, expell'd every Sentiment of Charity and Benevolence, and contracted and abridg'd some of his Vices, even when he had the Power of being Vicious. In a Word, Sir John had a Negative Character, and acquir'd the Title of a good Sort of Man; that is, his Vices were not many, but he had not a single Virtue.

HE had seen enough of one Part of the World to convince him that there was no such Thing as a modest Woman. This happy Imagination kept him a Batchelor, till, at the Age of Sixty-three, Love, or some other Monosyllable, stumbled into his Head. —The Charms of Miss Bridoon, his Sadler's

Daughter, made him so generous as to propose a Marriage and relinquish a Fortune. Whilst this Treaty was on Foot, his Relations interpos'd, and some of his most intimate Friends spoke pretty freely about it. They said, It was highly prudent in him to marry, but begg'd he would consider his Age and the Infirmities growing on him. That a Girl of Eighteen was quite out of the Rule of Proportion. That a Mechanick's Daughter was unworthy his Rank and Fortune, and an Indignity to his Family. That no one could answer for the Conduct of a young Girl, especially one of low Education, and begg'd him to turn his Eyes on some Lady, whose Years would Guarantee her Virtue, and make him happy in a faithful Companion.


OONS, cry'd the Knight, what the Plague would you be at? I tell you, my Age is no Impediment, for I find myself as vigorous as at Twenty. If Children, not my own, inherit my Name and Estate, is it not the Practice of every Day? Is it not much better than the Heathen Scheme of Adoption?—The Honour of my Family, which my virtuous Sister makes such a Noise about, is a Farce, and I suppose she thought so, when she

ran away with my Father's Footman. Does she imagine, that the Son of such a Scoundrel shall enjoy my Fortune?— Then as to a virtuous Wife, I know the World too well to expect such a one, but I likewise know, that I had rather have a Part in a young Wench, than the Whole of any old Woman breathing.—In short, Sir John was resolute, or rather, positive. Miss Bridoon was advanc'd to his Bed, and Consummatum est, rang through the Parish.

LADY CURIOUS was extremely pretty. Her Eyes spoke, and her great Vivacity and Sprightliness had attractive Qualities. —An House magnificently furnish'd.—A Number of Servants, with Coach, Chariot, &amp;c. were so infinitely beyond her Hopes, that her little Head began to turn. Her Constitution and Soil were so good, that the seeds of Example grew up surprizingly fast, and afforded a plentiful Crop of the most fashionable Follies. In a short Time, she had contracted a Variety of Acquaintance, and vastly improv'd in modern Politeness.—Plays, Operas and Visits, went a constant Round, and Drums, Routs and Assemblies employ'd her Time, at Home and Abroad. She had a Passion for Play, and play'd very deep. Here, indeed, her low Birth was conspicuous, for, not being

educated from her Childhood, like other Ladies of Quality, in the true Principles of Gaming, she made but a small Progress in that Science, and play'd so ill, and lost so much Money, that her charming Company was greatly courted and admir'd.
SIR JOHN was very indifferent about these Matters. He allow'd her two hundred Pounds a Year as Pin-Money, but was so rigid and exact, that no Art, nor all her Ladyship's Contrivances, could extract a Shilling more. — Conyers knew of large Sums lost at Cards, and was surprized how her Ladyship could answer so many Demands; but at last he discover'd, that her Play-Purse was inexhaustible.—Notwithstanding the Multitude of Affairs, and the Variety of Employments on her Hands, she found a Time to present to Sir John a Brace of fine Boys. Her Ladyship was Happy, the old Knight was Content, and Family Affairs went on with great Harmony.
IN about three Months Conyers pick'd out this Information from the Steward, and Mrs. Sieve, her Ladyship's Woman. This last threw in some Nods, Winks, and Innuendos, but the Honour of her Lady was always sacred. Mrs. Sieve conceived a good Opinion of Jack, and on many Occasions

gave him Proofs of her Esteem.— He had felt the fatal Effects of such Friendship, and was determin'd to avoid every Temptation.—He shunn'd her Presence as much as possible, and even slighted her Favours.—His Conduct was such an Affront to her Pride and Beauty, that she shifted Sides, and became an implacable Enemy.
THIS kind Creature had laid many Schemes to prepossess her Lady against Jack. She insinuated, that his Impudence had not only dar'd to make Attempts on her Virtue, but had even mutter'd Reflections on her Ladyship. — Fir'd at his Insolence, my Lady determin'd to have him immediately kicked out, but the artful Sieve begg'd of her Ladyship not to disparage herself so much as to speak of such an Affair, but to worm the the Fellow out by Degrees.

THE Resolution being taken, my Lady never ceased teizing Sir John till he grew peevish.—Mrs. Sieve affronted Jack openly, and the Steward treated him with great Impertinence. Conyers found a very visible Change in the Countenances of the whole Family, and was made very uneasy in his Duty, but knew not what to ascribe it to.

—One Evening, Sir John used him a little harshly, but the Humility of Jack spoke much in his Favour, and oblig'd the Knight, with some good Humour, to ask him, What he had done to my Lady and her Woman?— I protest, Sir, said Jack, I have done nothing. — Nothing! cry'd Sir John, Nay then I know your Crime; you can never be forgiven.—Oons! a Handsome Fellow of your Age in such a Family as this, and do Nothing! — Thou art a silly Blockhead, and I am sorry for it, but, Travel you must; however, I'm determin'd you shall stay till I get you another Service, and have one in your Place.

JACK had been so accustom'd to Disappointments, that he bore this with great Temper and Resignation. He inform'd his Friend Dr. St. Amour of this Revolution, and told him what was the Occasion of it, which he had learn'd from the House-Maid. The good Man lifted up his Eyes, begg'd of him to have Patience, and promis'd to look out for a more agreeable Employment.
SOME Days after, Conyers was busy with Sir John when Mr. Sampson enter'd. The Knight had a great Regard for this Gentleman, and was extremely Civil to him. Well, Friend Sampson, said he, Time was,

when we us'd to meet oftner, but this plaguy Gout makes me perform a tedious Quarentine you see.'—'Ah, Sir John, reply'd Mr. Sampson, you are at Anchor in a safe Harbour, but I have all your Ailments, and am buffetted about in stormy Winds. — 'Not so, not so, answer'd the Knight, I hope my old Friend and Acquaintance is in no Danger of Shipwreck.—No Misfortunes I hope.'— None, said Mr. Sampson, but what my Temper can bear.—I have lost my only Child, just such a Youth as that, (pointing to Jack.) I have lost the best Part of my Substance by the War, and I have found old Age and Infirmities.—But, is it not just, I should resign with Patience what I enjoy'd and held but at the Will of the Donor?


MR. SAMPSON, said Sir John, you were always a Philosopher, but I am really concern'd at your Misfortunes. Perhaps some Money, at this Time, may have its Use, and I wish it was in my Power to assist you, but, really my Family is so expensive, that I am quite poor at present. I wish I had seen you last Week, for, 'tis but two Days ago since I parted with all my ready Money on a Mortgage.—Truly I am angry at

your not acquainting me with your Distresses—Indeed I am — and you know the Pleasure I take in assisting my worthy Friends.'—'You are extremely good, reply'd Mr. Sampson, but, thank God, I am in no want. When my Debts are collected, which are very numerous, I shall have more than sufficient to maintain my dear Wife and I, in a comfortable Manner. Indeed I am ill able to attend my Friends, and much want an honest young Fellow to assist me.'—'I believe, said Sir John, I am pretty deep in your Books. — The last Christening consum'd a deal of Wine; but if you have the Bill, I shall see and discharge it.— Mr. Sampson thank'd the Knight, and receiv'd one hundred and forty Pounds, for which Jack drew a Receipt for him to sign. —I protest, Sir, said the Merchant, your young Man writes a charming Hand, and I dare say understands Accounts.'— That he does, answer'd Sir John, and extremely well. He is honest, sober, and diligent, and I heartily wish you had his Equal. What will you give me, Mr. Sampson, if I assign him over to you, provided he consents?—I shall give you, answer'd the other, my sincere Thanks, and the young Man the best Usage in

my Power.'—'In two Words, reply'd the Knight, I know of no Fault he has, but being too virtuous and modest for my good Family. My Lady's Maid has set my Lady against him. I know their Tricks, but I don't mind them.

SOME Questions pass'd, and in less than half an Hour the Affair was concluded on. — Jack received fifteen Pounds for six Months Wages, and wishing Sir John all Happiness, once more shifted his Station.



CHAP. VIII.


A genealogical Table, true or false, of illustrious Ancestors: a large Estate: a numerous Equipage, and considerable Employments, are what we generally call Noble. But Virtue judges in a different Manner. She takes the Great from amidst the Grandour which surrounds him: Undresses him of the Vanity that disguises him, and rates the Value of the Man by the Man himself. Under the Appearance of Nobility she may find a Fool, a Villain, or a Coward; and in a Plebeian Obscurity discover real Greatness and Probity of Manners. As right Reason is of all Countries, the Wise in all Ages have spoken on this Subject in one uniform, constant Manner.

SANADON'S Note on 6th S. of 1st B. of Horace.


OUR Hero is now brought to that Time of Life, when Sense and Judgment are to be expected, or never. He has been happy.—He has been in Trouble.— He has been (for him) rich.—He has been poor, and in the utmost Affliction. These

are the Pages of the Book of Nature, and those who read them not carefully, must have very imperfect Ideas of the System of the Universe.
HE was once more happy. He had a Pleasure from the Countenance of Mr. Sampson, which was open and free, with every Indication of an honest and tender Heart. Mrs. Sampson could not refrain a few Tears at the Sight of Conyers, for it happen'd that he much resembled her deceased Son. She view'd him with Pleasure, but it was mix'd with Anxiety. She regarded him as a Child, and he respected her as a Parent.

IN his Employment he was extremely assiduous and careful, and went on very successfully in collecting Mr. Sampson's Debts, and settling his Accounts. The good Man was happy; for Conyers, as much as possible, made all Things easy to him. In a short Time he acquir'd their Favour and Confidence, and was perfectly familiar.—The Boy, the very young Man was quite over. His Thoughts were serious, but he acted with Vigour. His Deportment was decent, and his Conversation chearful and agreeable. His Duty was his Pleasure, and the Love and Respect of the Family was his Reward, which they could not avoid shewing before all their Friends.
MRS. Sampson and her Sister had been Coheiresses, and had each an Estate in *******, of about Five hundred Pounds a Year. The Sister had been married to Mr. Gold, a Turkey Merchant, who died about four Years since, and added Fifteen thousand Pounds to her Fortune. Mrs. Gold was near Thirty-seven Years of Age, of a noble Presence, with great good Nature and Prudence. She continued a Widow in Spite of many Sollicitations, and so affectionately lov'd her Sister, that she remov'd her Habitation to be nearer to her. When Mr. Sampson was in Distress with his Creditors, Mrs. Gold advanc'd him Six thousand Pounds on his and her Sister's Security.
THE Sisters were almost constantly with each other, and Conyers was always of the Party.—Mrs. Gold had read, and had an excellent Understanding. Mrs. Sampson was a chearful and agreeable Companion. — Her Husband had solid Sense, and great good Humour; and Conyers enliven'd the Conversation by a thousand pleasant Circumstances, but with such natural Elegance and Beauty, that greatly pleas'd, improv'd and diverted.

SOMETIMES their Entertainment was of a serious Nature, and fell on the Follies of the World; — The mad Extravagance of some, and the equally mad Penury of others.—On Justice, Virtue, Charity, and the like. — Mrs. Gold spoke on these Heads with great Strength of Reason, and Mr. Conyers enforced her Arguments by sundry historical Passages, and by Accidents to which he had been Witness. He was a Master of the Subject, and, at different Times, went through the moral and social Duties, with such Spirit and Force, that they were charm'd with his Knowledge, and edified by his Words.

HAPPY would it be, said Mrs. Gold, if all Mankind thought like Mr. Conyers.'— And still more so, reply'd her Sister, if they acted like him, for I verily believe he practises his own Doctrine.'—'Madam, answer'd Conyers, I am extremely happy in your good Opinion; but permit me to say, tho' I endeavour, and I hope, do my Duty as I ought, yet I have greatly err'd. I have been idle; I have been extravagant, and, I speak it to my Shame, I have been vicious; but the Goodness of this Family strengthens my Resolution, and confirms me in my honest Purposes of Amendment.'—'If,

reply'd Mrs. Gold, you have been criminal, your Confession and Repentance encreases your Worth.'—'Who has not been criminal? said Mr. Sampson. — To commit a Fault is bad, but to persevere is infamous. For aught I know, Vice has its Use, as it sets off and heightens the Beauties of Virtue to such a Degree, that Common Sense, and even Ignorance, must be charm'd with it.—'Mr. Conyers, said Mrs. Gold, has one Virtue which I wish was a little more general. Tho' he has been so good, agreeably to entertain us with Persons and Things, yet has he never dropp'd an harsh Expression against Particulars, nor has he given Matters an ill natur'd Construction.


SCANDAL, Madam, said Conyers, let it inhabit where it will, is a mean and vulgar Vice. It is a poor and vile Attempt to raise our own Reputation on the Ruins of another. When some condemn the Actions of a Man, and paint his Conduct in odious Colours, do they not at the same Time modestly intimate, that They are incapable of such Errors?— Pride speaks; not their Pity. To compassionate the Frailties and Weaknesses of a Man, is the Duty of a Man. It is his Office to set him Right by Tenderness

and Humanity, and not by Reproach and Slander to lead him more astray. Should he continue in his Folly, the wisest Maxim is, to commiserate his Infirmities, and avoid an Imitation.

SOME Evenings they pass'd their Time at Cards, and sometimes the Ladies went to a Play, attended by Conyers. This gave Rise to a Variety of pleasant Chat, where Jack shew'd his Memory and good Taste, but it was a considerable Time before they discover'd he had an excellent Voice. Mrs. Gold was fond of Musick, and he humming a favourite Air,—Bless me, said she, I protest you have it quite perfect,—we must insist on your Singing it out.—He made a few Apologies but obey'd.—This was what the Family did not expect, and increased their Surprize and Pleasure.—By degrees he shew'd his Skill in the French Language, — that he was no Stranger to Latin and Greek, and that he understood Dancing, Fencing and Horsemanship. In a Word, he shew'd them what a Gentleman ought to be.
THE Behaviour of Conyers puzzled Mrs. Gold.—She could not conceive how a Man in his Station could acquire so many genteel Accomplishments. She thought there was a Mystery in it, and when she had just determin'd

to find it out, Lord bless me, said she, why should I trouble myself about what is not my Concern? At that Instant she felt a prodigious Flushing in her Face, and some Sensations she had not been lately accustom'd to. She began to suspect the Cause, and with great Caution, sat down to examine her Heart, and reason with herself, — that is — to find out Reasons to correspond with her Inclinations. The Truth is, she discover'd so many, that Interest and the Pride of Family, were fairly routed, and Prudence and Esteem got the better. She would not call it Love, as she thought it a too sensual Term for one of her Years. She own'd she regarded the Virtues and Qualifications of Mr. Conyers, but the Comeliness of his Person was merely accidental, and quite out of the Question. However, that Contingent and his Youth had certainly some Weight.
BE this as it will, her Resolution was taken, but determin'd not to proceed too rashly. On a certain Day, when she knew her Sister would not stir out, she wrote her a Card, and begg'd Mr. Conyers might be sent to take care of her to the Play, where she was engaged with some Company. Jack dress'd himself properly, and waited on Mrs. Gold. He had no Schemes in

View, so his Actions were Free, and without Reserve. He had a great Regard for the Widow, which made him fond of every Opportunity of obliging her. Perhaps she had observed this, and gave it a flattering Construction. He found her most neatly dress'd, and, for the first Time, particularly remark'd her Charms.

I AM quite asham'd, said she, to give Mr. Conyers so much Trouble for nothing. Our Party is broke, but rather than miss the Conscious Lovers, I was determin'd to beg your Company alone, had not Mrs. Talkative and her Daughter sent Word, they'd drink Tea with me.— Conyers said, he was sorry she was disappointed, but rejoiced at every Occasion that could shew his Readiness in obeying her Commands. A few Words pass'd, and he attempted to take his Leave, which she would not permit. After all, said she, we can be as well at Home, and my Brother will not expect you till after the Play. A Conversation then began on the Comedy, and many Remarks were made on the odd Situation of Indiana, and the noble Constancy of Bevil. A loud Rap at the Door spoke the Arrival of Mrs. and Miss Talkative, and stopp'd their Proceedings.

A NEW Field now open'd. In a short Time all the Tittle-tattle of the Parish was display'd. Lord, Mrs. Gold, you surprise me.—Not hear of this before! Not I indeed, Madam. Dear Madam, I purtest I've forgot most of the Particlers, for the Story is four Days old. Very strange indeed! Why, my dear, they were actually caught, but Matrimony salves all. This Sort of rational Entertainment lasted till Tea was produced, which a little eased the Thoughts of Conyers. He seem'd to bend his Eyes and Regard on Miss Talkative, who was very pretty, and had began a Sort of Conversation. Mrs. Gold observed it; which added not to her Repose. She was so absent, that her Tea-Cup slip'd from her Hand, and broke to Pieces, which broke off their Chat. Tea finish'd, she put on a grave Air, and the Ladies put on their Capuchins, to compleat their Evening Visits.
CONYERS, unwittingly, had like to have spoil'd all, but Mrs. Gold's hinting, 
One must be civil to such Sort of People, gave him an Opportunity of saying, He wonder'd of what Use they were in the World. The Daughter, said he, is pretty, but the eternal Clatter of her little Tongue will give some poor Man a great deal of Vexation.' 'And yet, said Mrs. Gold, her

Fortune will get her a Husband. You Men are all alike, and, I dare say, you would snap at her in an Instant, if you could.' 'I shall not, said Jack, affirm or deny a Thing I have not thought about, for I neither know the Lady or her Fortune; but really, Madam, I think I ought to have been exempted in your general Censure. Were I capable of marrying merely for Money, the Situation I am in, and my Poverty, would excuse me to the World, but who would excuse me to my Conscience? Who would give me Joy of an Equipage, when compell'd to take Pride, Affectation, Folly, and Non-sense to my Arms? I may be ambitious, but, I assure you, Madam, poor as I am, I have not the least Ambition of being miserable.


MRS. GOLD was not displeased at his Sentiments, and the Conversation turn'd on more diverting Subjects, tho' she, at last, very dextrously contrived to bring Matrimony once more on the Carpet. I own my Surprize, said she, that a young Man of your Understanding has not found out one Woman capable of making you happy and easy. Such there are, but you are either too indolent or indifferent, or else your Heart is engaged to some distant

Fair One. — Come, Mr. Conyers, be sincere, and indulge a Curiosity our Sex is subject to, and recite your Adventures, for I am apt to believe they must be somewhat extraordinary. — 'In Truth, Madam, said Conyers, they are not worth your Notice; but since you command, it is my Duty to obey.

HE then began a Narrative of his Life, and painted his Sufferings in a very moving Manner. He artfully avoided the Place of his Birth, or the least Hint of Ireland, as it might occasion Scandal. He carried her to the Weaver's in Spittlefields; conducted her to France, and brought her back to London. His Amours were very delicately handled, but his Hounslow Expedition was quite expunged. He dwelt long on Mr. Kindly's Instructions and Letter, and the Misery he was in in Surry. His History was long, and sometimes so affecting, that Mrs. Gold was obliged to make frequent Use of her Handkerchief. She pity'd him because he was unfortunate, and he began to love her, because he saw she pity'd him.—When he had ended, a profound Silence ensued.

SINCE, said she, at last, your Heart is free, perhaps I may assist in setting your Mind at Ease.— I thing I know a Lady

who has Power, and Inclination equal to it. Will you give me Leave to try my Skill? Permit me, Madam, said Jack, to return my most humble Acknowledgements for your Goodness; but as you have required my Sincerity, I shall still continue it, and with that honest Freedom your good Sense will excuse. I have no Objections, Madam, to Matrimony, and have a certain Constancy in my Nature, that might make me a good Husband; but I cannot answer for my Temper, if I did not most affectionately love my Wife. To have that Love, I must know her, I must converse with her; I must first admire her Virtues, and esteem her Understanding. This, Madam, is not the Work of a Week, or a Month; and to marry otherwise, there is a Possibility of being happy, but the Chances are infinitely against me. True, I may be made rich, but an hundred to one I may be made wretched.



YOUR Reasons, said Mrs. Gold, are very just; yet I believe you will allow there are some Exceptions, neither do I want any personal Compliment when I ask you, if a Woman of Fortune, and every-way like me, could please you?— Madam,—said Jack,—I—I—really know

not how or what to answer. She saw him confused, and added,—I shall make it plainer. Suppose for Argument-Sake, I should have such a Notion in my Head, —Do you think you could truly and sincerely regard me?' Regard you, Madam, reply'd Conyers,— 'Yes, on my Soul, I should for ever regard, love and adore you! — But, dear Madam, why do you take Pleasure in tormenting so poor an Animal? — Why do you question me like a Prisoner on the Rack, and make me confess, what my Safety obliges me to hide?—'But I have done, and can scarcely hope your Pardon, for what I've already said.'—'Mr. Conyers, said she, with a bashful Air, I not only pardon, but shall endeavour to mitigate your Anxieties. I have seen and examin'd your Conduct; I have view'd your Actions; I have read your Heart, and, I think, have discover'd in you a Soul incapable of Meanness or Falshood.—Though you have no Fortune, I have often thought you deserv'd one. — I speak to your Understanding, and am not afraid of being censur'd by it. Let the lucrative World run after Wealth. It has pleas'd Heaven to indulge me with enough to make too rational Creatures happy. Should you be

of the same Opinion, the little Share I can give, is freely at your Service.

SHE hung down her Head, and impatiently waited a Reply.—Conyers gaz'd— his Eyes were fix'd, and his Mouth could only seem to speak. At length he rose up, and throwing aside all Consideration, embrac'd Mrs. Gold in so tender, so ardent a Manner, that convinc'd her of his Sincerity, beyond the Utterance of a thousand Words, and vain Speeches. Confess, said she, that I have acted like a Woman of Courage, by making the first Attack; I wish my Prudence be not more suspected.' Tho', said Conyers, the World will talk, yet, believe me, I shall give them such a Subject, that our Love and Harmony shall be rather envy'd than imitated. — Give me Leave to call you my dearest Life, and to assure you, without Vanity, that you entirely possess an Heart free from Flattery, Art, or Deceit. Oh! make me once more happy, and say you will be mine.' Mr. Conyers, said she, there is my Hand. My Heart you have already. But, no more. You have my Promise, and rely on it.' 'Dear Madam, said Conyers, let me not seem too impatient, by asking when?' 'Be satisfied, said she, it shall not be long, for I hope soon

to bring my Brother and Sister into my Scheme; but I beg your Silence till then.

CONYERS promis'd to be directed by her; and Supper being serv'd, a different Conversation began. However it was once more renew'd, and many tender and affectionate Expressions, the Eloquence of undisguis'd Passion, were mutually given and receiv'd, till Time, with hasty Steps approach'd the Hour of Twelve.—With some Difficulty they parted.—He soon retir'd to Bed, but not to Rest, for Mrs. Gold had murder'd Sleep.

'TWOULD be tedious to mention the Method she took to open this Affair to her Sister. She was her own Mistress, but still wanted a Sanction. No doubt the Reader will imagine the Surprize of the Family, and he must likewise imagine the many Arguments on both Sides, before Mrs. Sampson, and her Husband, consented, which at last they did. The Truth is, Mrs. Gold, like most of the World, ask'd Advice, but was determin'd to follow her own. There was no Necessity for a Settlement, but a small Writing was drawn in Favour of Children, on Failure of which, the longest Liver took all, except Five thousand Pounds, which each had a Power to bequeath by Will.


THUS all Matters being adjusted, the Day was fix'd, and Doctor St. Amour acquainted with it, who provided a proper Place at Putney, where he met the Company. The good Man loaded Jack with Caresses and Compliments, and felicitated Mrs. Gold on her happy Choice. I must, Madam, said he, admire, and shall for ever admire your Judgment and Understanding, that could discover Virtue and Honour under the Cloud of Poverty; dispel the Mist, and take it to your Arms. —He made a very pathetick Discourse, but his Conclusion was infinitely pleasing to Mr. Conyers, and, perhaps, not less so to Mrs. Gold, for he join'd their Hands, and, ending his Part of the Ceremony, bless'd the Happy Pair, and left them to finish the Remainder.




CHAP. IX.


Grant me the social Joys of Life
In easy, Converse, free from Strife;
Not wrangling for an empty Name,
But raising Virtue into Fame.
Not, with vile Breath, abuse the Great,
And prate, because I dare to prate;

But, hear Instruction, or to give,

And Learn, or Teach, each Day I live.

ANONIMOUS.



THE Generality of the World regard the Actions of Men, but according to the Event. A prosperous Villain may be internally despised, tho' his Wealth and Grandeur will be outwardly admir'd, and even envy'd.—Praise is sacrificed to poor and indigent Virtue, but every other Reward is too frequently neglected. The wise Man of Old tells us, That Time and Chance happeneth unto all Men.—When Misfortunes and Calamities attack us, the World is so good to pity, but at the same Time, impute the Unhappiness to a Want of proper Conduct, and to a Multitude of Errors. —When Affluence pours in, and Plenty surrounds

us, they admire the Judgment, and applaud the Understanding. —Thus, the Wretched and Miserable tax Providence with Partiality, but the Happy and Successful, attribute all to their own Prudence and superior Merit.

OUR Friend Mr. Conyers could not avoid some few Compliments to his Person and Abilities, as they were the Motives of his Advancement; but when he reflected on the Goodness of his Wife in noticing and rewarding them so amply, he discover'd, that they proceeded from a superior Cause, which, as it reach'd above his Comprehension, he could only wonder at, and, by praising the Giver, make Returns of Love and Gratitude to the Instrument.—By reasoning thus, and lowering his own Value as much as he heighten'd the Goodness of Providence, his Mind became more calm, and his Heart less liable to Vanity. He was not too elate, or puff'd up; for, by regarding his Wife more than her Fortune, the World was compell'd to believe he deserv'd both.— Never was Woman more happy than Mrs. Conyers, and never could a Husband take more Pains to oblige a Wife. ENVY saw this, but hid her Head.—MALICE, with squinting Eye, and jibing Tongue, look'd and spoke in vain. JEALOUSY and vile

INSINUATION found their Arrows blunted, or sticking in the Shield of right Understanding. The Fabrick was so firmly fix'd on Honour and Good Sense, that the Decay of Nature could alone sap the Foundation.

MR. CONYERS still assisted his Brother Sampson, and having got in most of his Debts, and settled all his Affairs, proposed, at the Request of his Wife, to retire to the Country. They agreed to live in a small Town near their Estate, and having provided every Houshold Necessary, and a good Collection of Books, they quitted the noisy City, for the Peace, Tranquillity and Joys of a Rural Life. He now found himself possess'd of above Twelve Hundred Pounds a Year, and, calling to his Memory the Conduct of Lord Truegood, resolved, as near as possible, to follow the Example of so worthy a Nobleman. Like a prudent General, he plann'd out his Operations; he collected his Forces, and assign'd to each Part a just Proportion. His Distribution was exact; but Mrs. Conyers changed it a little, by making him sensible, that his Scheme had not provided for Sickness, and many other Accidents they were liable to. Let us, my Dear, said she, live as genteely as you please; But where is the absolute Necessity of

spending our whole Income? My Advice is, to save at least Three hundred Pounds a Year, to answer Contingencies, and assist a worthy Friend on Occasion; neither do I see how we can well lay out the Remainder. My Life, said Jack; you are quite in the Right; then be it so: It is but striking out these two extraordinary Horses, a Servant, one Dish a Day, something from the Wine, and a little from the Allowance of Cloaths and pleasurable Expences, and the Affair is just as you desire.

THE Behaviour of this Family soon acquired the Esteem and Respect of the neighbouring Gentlemen and Ladies. Particular Friendships were form'd, and a charming Society enlivened every Amusement.—Some Gentlemen met twice a Week at the best Inn in the Town, to benefit the House, and keep up a proper Interest, and our Friend was soon invited to be of the Number. It will not be amiss to mention some of this good Company.
SIR John Dobson, and old Colonel Manly, were the principal. The Knight had been Member for the County in three Parliaments, as the Colonel had been for the Town for almost Forty Years. Mr. Leatherhead, Mr. Ash, Doctor Grace, who was Minister of the

Parish, and Mr. Conyers, made six constant Companions. Our Ladies were happy with Mrs. Grace and Family, and with Miss Lucy Manly the Daughter of the Colonel, now a most amiable Girl of Seventeen Years of Age. Her Wit and Understanding, with her tender and compassionate Heart, made her the Joy of her Friends. No Wonder the Colonel was extremely fond, for she was the Child of his Age, and his only one. He spoke with Pleasure of the vast Fortune he intended to leave her, and often said, he almost envy'd the happy Man to whose Lot she fell.
WITH great Care and Attention have I examined the original Memoirs of this History, but unfortunately found not the least Hint of Amours, or, as it is called, the Gallantry of Mr. Conyers, during his Residence in the Country. This must certainly be a tedious Time to a Reader of Genius, who expects at every Page, a well or ill-contrived Intrigue, or somewhat wonderful or surprising to raise his Imagination, and keep up his Attention.—Tho' I cannot answer these valuable Ends, I cannot pass in Silence this Space, as my Materials are large, but must supply the Want of extraordinary Adventures in this seeming State of Inactivity, with the Substance of the

most interesting Subjects, that made their Evenings pass usefully and agreeably away.
IN doing this I shall stick to my usual Brevity, and trespass as little as possible on the Patience of the Good-natur'd. I shall not summon them to every Assembly, but vary the Subject by an Asterism, (*) and avoid that Sort of Connection that might pin me down to Form and Ceremonies.

* * *

IN our last Argument, said Mr. Conyers, Sir John gave us a long Dissertation on the Liberty of the Press. I think we all agreed to the Usefulness of it in general, and to the Danger of suppressing any Part; yet I cannot help thinking it a little hard, that a Person shall have it in his Power to make a Man ridiculous whenever he pleases to imagine he does Wrong. What are most of our Pamphlets and News Papers stuff'd with, but Encomiums on those out of Place, and scurrilous Reflections on those in?—Were we to shift the Scene, would not the new Ministry be abused like the former, and perhaps, by the same Writers? I do not pretend to be a Politician, but believe, many who do are just as ignorant as I am. Every Man who spells, may write Satyr, that is, may write maliciously, as it requires little or no Genius; but to write with Truth, Candour, and Impartiality, to have Judgment sufficient to point out real Errors, but Humanity and Good-nature not to strike at Persons and Characters, is not given to every Man.
I GRANT you, said Sir John, some make an ill Use of Liberty, and leap beyond the Bounds; if they go too far, the Law is open, and to the Law we must leave them. 'Tis very true, said Mr. Conyers, but they have found out a jesuitical Way of evading even the best Law. Here are a Parcel of Pamphlets and News-Papers (which he threw on the Table) fill'd with initial Letters, Dashes, and Stars. Tho' we clearly see the Insolence and Treason, what Jury, as the Law now stands, can properly condemn the Author or Printer to lose his Ears?'— 'Well, well, said Sir John, no Matter, let them scribble on, provided they do not oblige me to believe all their Impertinence.'—Men of Sense, Sir John, answer'd Conyers, will always think in that Manner, but how many honest well-meaning Gentlemen suffer themselves to be imposed on, merely for Want of due Attention. Perhaps some must write thus, or starve. In that Case, I sincerely

pity them, yet I hope Mankind have not such vitiated Tastes, as to be delighted only with Scandal. Would a Writer fix on a Plan of Instruction.—Would he inculcate the Fear of God, and Honour to the King — Would he endeavour to make us better Parents, better Children, and better Friends to Society—Would he employ his Time and Learning to persuade us to Unanimity, and not Discord and Confusion. Who amongst us—what honest Man, but would praise and applaud him? But to write from Principles of Envy and Ill-nature, and to sow those pestilent Seeds in the Minds of the Unwary, is certainly a Conduct that even Vice will condemn. To him who writes fluently and well, but with such Intentions, I shall only say what a noble Lord did of the Earl of Stafford, That God had given him Talents, but the Devil the Application.

WERE it possible, said the Doctor, to restrain the Liberty of the Press without endangering the Liberty of the People, I am convinced we should be much happier and much more free from Squabbles and idle Disputes; but the Experiment is of too tender and delicate a Nature, to wish seeing it attempted, tho' I verily believe News-Writers and Pamphleteers are the Collectors of the fifth great Tax in the Kingdom.
* * *
—WHATEVER the Equity may be, said Sir John, I hope never to see a new Valuation for a Land-Tax. Our Acres are pretty well charged already, so let them look elsewhere, if they want to raise more Money.—Yet, reply'd Mr. Conyers, all Taxes must at last center on Land.' I must beg Leave, reply'd the Doctor, to differ from you.— For Example: Suppose that a Duty was laid on the Exportation of our Nobility and Gentry, according to their Titles. How could such a Tax affect the Land?'— They travel for Health or Pleasure, and I think ought to pay Fifty or an Hundred Pounds to their own Country, for Permission to spend the Remainder of their Fortunes in another. Upon my Word, said Squire Ash, a very notable and reasonable Scheme! Then, continued the Doctor, if every Man, who accepted an Employment of One hundred Pounds a Year, was obliged to pay a Year's Salary to the State, and a proportionable Tax on the Commissioners of Land and Sea-Officers, would it not raise a large Sum, and how would it affect our Lands?— In Holland they have what is called a Collateral Tax, that is, the Inheriter of a Fortune in Land or Money, not descending to him in a direct Line, pays 2 ½ per Cent. to the State. When they sell Lands or Tenements, the Seller and Purchaser pay two or three per Cent. of the Value to the Government.—Thus, Gentlemen, it is plain, there are many Ways of raising Money, where Taxes, so far from raising our Manufactures, might be so managed, as to go infinitely cheaper to Foreign Markets.
I ASSURE you, cried Colonel Manly, I never thought my Friend Doctor Grace, had so calculating an Head, and I dare say, were the Ministry acquainted with his Genius, he would soon have Lawn Sleeves. I am so pleased with his Money Projects, that I must add one, which I wonder he forgot. For Example: Suppose all the Livings of the Clergy of England were to be new valued, and the Clergy who succeed, after a certain Day, were obliged to pay to the Government one Year of that Valuation by four equal Payments in four Years. Would not this likewise make a large Fund? And how would it affect our Lands? Permit me to explain my Scheme by Figures.




'Doctor Grace has Church-Preferments to above 500 
l.
a Year. I shall only charge
450
l.
Out of this I shall deduct, 'Full Land Tax at 4 
s.
90
'Two Curates — at most
60
'Remainder clear to the Doctor, besides Marriage, Christening, and Burial Fees,
300
l.
450



Now, I would value these Livings but at Two Hundred Pounds a Year in the King's New Books, and where would be the mighty Injustice to oblige his Successor to pay that Sum in four Years? And how would it affect our Lands?' Were this Chamber, reply'd the Doctor, a Chamber of Parliament, I should vastly disappoint the Colonel, by heartily concurring in such a Scheme, properly regulated, but I should certainly Vote for exempting the poor Clergy. Agreed, said the Colonel, so let it be resolved, that no Clergyman shall be liable to this New Duty, who has not One Hundred Pounds a Year clear of all Deductions.' 'Raillery apart, said Mr. Conyers, I sincerely think,

somewhat of this Nature ought to be done, and the Clergy of France have set us very good Examples. The Wisdom of Government is best seen in the just Partition of Taxes. To charge them who are rich in this World, is true Policy, and to ease the poor Labourer, is equal to it. To lessen the Tax on the Consumption of the Poor, is, in Fact, an Advantage to the Rich, as all Manufactures and Workmanship must lessen in Proportion.
THE Doctor mention'd, said Sir John, something of poor Clergy. I am really asham'd to see so many, in such a Country as England, who appear like Objects of Charity, and thought, that when QUEEN ANNE gave up her first Fruits to buy Glebe and Impropriated Tythes, they would all have comfortable Livings; but I am vastly disappointed, nor can I conceive why they are not in a better Situation.' 'All I know, reply'd the Doctor, is, that the Trustees for that useful Work have had the first Fruits and Tenths above Thirty Years. They have purchased many Glebes, and, I dare say, from their great Virtues and high Dignities, every Thing in their Power has been done for the Good of the CHURCH, If they have not added more to the Livings

of poor Clergy, I must suppose they could get no more to purchase, or wanted a Fund.
FAR be it from me, said Mr. Conyers, to hint the least Reflection on the Honour or Integrity of Gentlemen in such eminent Stations, but from what the Doctor has said, and from what I have heard on this Subject, I must conclude, that there has been no Misapplication of Money. On the contrary, I am inform'd very little has been apply'd. If my Intelligence be true, a Capital, and the Interest of a Capital, has been suffer'd to accumulate to so mighty a Sum, that I am cautious to mention it. The Revenue is certainly large, and should the Trustees not have found out Purchases, I see no Reason but that Twenty, Thirty, or Forty Pounds in Money, should be given annually to many poor Clergymen, which, I humbly apprehend, would fully answer the Intent of the charitable Donor. Whether the Trustees have expended their whole Fund, or whether they are enabled to support Twenty or Two Hundred Clergymen, I cannot positively assert; but sure I am, that as the Wisdom of the Legislature would not be less manifested by a fair and honest Enquiry into it;

so I am equally satisfied, that the Integrity and Honour of the Trustees would be thus clearly demonstrated, and malevolent and clamorous Tongues silenced.
* * *
TRULY, Sir John, said the Doctor, I am sorry Matters were carried so far Yesterday. We had warm Words, very warm Words. In the Name of Goodness, what had They or We to do in the Affair? If the French prevail over us, I am sorry for it, and pray God it may be otherwise. If we beat them, I rejoice and am thankful. But to argue, that some Things ought to have been done, and that others ought to have been undone, is certainly idle, for, I profess, I believe we know nothing of the Matter.' 'Right, Right, said Sir John, but you know my Rule is, never to contradict or dispute about what I do not understand, especially when I am convinc'd that my Antagonist is equally ignorant.
SUCH Disputants, said the Colonel, are the Plague of Society. The more they seem Gentlemen, the more Mischief they do, for, as they choose, and commonly herd but with People of inferior Capacities, they pass current for vast Geniuses, and are applauded for their mighty Understandings.

I have often laugh'd to hear a Company of honest Citizens, fighting over the very Battles I had been in, and minutely mentioning a thousand Circumstances that never did or could have happen'd, and have endeavour'd, and sometimes with Success, to put my good Countrymen right. I remember when I was a young Man, and return'd from the Campaign of 1707, when the Duke of Marlborough did not fight the French, I stroll'd into a City Coffee-house, where a young pert Soap-boiler was most eloquently displaying his Talents, and diverting his Audience with the Blunders and Misconduct of the Duke. — I own I was foolish enough to be provok'd, and long'd to chastize his Insolence. At last, the young Man to illustrate his Subject, chalk'd out two Lines on the Table.— Now, Gentlemen, said he, here lay the French,—and here the Allied Army, with this trifling River between them.—Now, (still pointing with his Finger) why the Devil the Duke did not cross the River, and beat the French Scoundrels, is past my Comprehension." — 'He was proceeding, but I lost all Patience, for, stretching over my Cane, I gave his Fingers a pretty severe Rebuke.—He rose

in Anger, and demanded a Reason, when I very coolly reply'd.—It was only to convince him, that in passing a River, an Army might receive a Rap over the Knuckles. The Laugh of the Company was on my Side, and the poor Soap-Boiler look'd mighty silly.
WHY there it is, said Sir John, an honest innocent Man can't speak his Mind freely, but up comes a Red Coat, and knocks him down. — The Colonel says, he was then young and foolish, but how many have we of the same Stamp, at this Day? — God help us! when we are to be govern'd, or, rather, controul'd by a Standing Army! — 'God help us, indeed, reply'd the Colonel, but for my Part, I promise you I will never live to see that Day.'—'That may be, answer'd 'Squire Ash; but really I can't help thinking, some People are making large Strides towards it, and where it may end, Heaven knows! —Is't not a plain Case, they want to make us a military Government, by raising such an Army, and employing them in a foolish War on the Continent, where, every News Paper will tell you, we have not the least Business? — If we must have a War, and be blooded by Taxes, let us, a God's Name, give

the Queen of Hungary her Belly-full of Money, but let us spare the Blood of Old England.

WELL said, Mr. Ash, reply'd Sir John, you speak my Sentiments, and, I believe the Sentiments of every honest Man in Great Britain; but I am afraid all this mighty Hurry and Noise, and Expence of Blood and Treasure, is more on Account of some G— D—, than any Good intended to us. If they mean a real Advantage to England, let them send forth her Wooden Walls and scour the Ocean.—We may do some Good there, and let Europe fight on the Continent to Eternity, provided we keep them out of our own natural Territories; nay, the more they quarrel and knock one another's Brains out Abroad, the better it is for us at Home. Read our Annals, Colonel. They were glorious Times, when our honest Militia, headed by Country Gentlemen, could step out and beat the French on their own Ground.' 'Pray, Sir, said the Colonel, what Business had these Country Gentlemen and gallant Militia in France? — 'Business! reply'd Sir John, —why, they went to conquer and keep the French at a Distance; and when they had conquer'd, to keep their Conquests.

Had we not NORMANDY, AQUITAIN, ANJOU, and almost Half of France? Very true, answer'd the Colonel, and, as if it were done to shew us our Folly, a Woman drove this mighty Militia almost out of All.' 'Ay, said Mr. Conyers, and we were full as Glorious when we burnt this poor Woman for a Witch. Those, said the Doctor, were the Days of glorious Ignorance!' 'Had our Ancestors conquer'd Part of France, or had Provinces descended by Right to our Kings, they were mad to pretend to keep them for the Good of England.—Had they erected a Kingdom within that Kingdom, and given it an Head of Importance and Weight, they would have done wisely.' — 'Very well observ'd, cry'd Mr. Conyers; I fear the Church Militant will be too hard for Country Gentlemen.
I MUST beg your Patience, said Colonel Manly, for I have a few Words to offer, and hope I shall never be call'd on this Subject again.
THE Vicinity, said he, of Great Britain and France, and the Rivalship in Glory and Trade, will ever make them natural Enemies to each other. The Views of France are as unbounded as Ambition. Our's are more confin'd, and

rather lead us to checque the exorbitant Power of others, than to increase our own.
WHEN LEWIS the XIVth made War on the Dutch, and gave his GLORY for the Reason, it was the Height of true Glory to resist and checque such an unchristian Scheme; but unhappily, our CHARLES the Second was his Pensioner.
WHEN this mighty Lewis, contrary to Faith and solemn Treaties, gave SPAIN to his Grandson, our Interest joined to frustrate the Project; but when Charles our King of Spain became Head of the Empire, our Interest opposed his being Master of two such Monarchies, tho', perhaps, our Policy was unsound to suffer Spain to fall to any Branch of the House of BOURBON.
IN the present War, when France, in Violation of the most solemn Engagements, and in the Midst of profound Peace, attack'd the Empire; — when she had made the QUEEN of HUNGARY a Fugitive, even to the Subjects she, or her Family, had oppressed the most;—when she had near overturned the great Weight that kept her Ambition from trampling on the Neck of Europe, our Interest, our

Happiness and our Honour compell'd us to join against her.—If our little Army in Flanders, was not so successful as we wish'd, they were led on with a noble Spirit, they fought like themselves, and retired from Numbers, rather fatigu'd than conquer'd. — We now know the TRUTH. We now know the Value of HANOVERIAN Troops, tho' Patriots, or rather Party, deprived us of 15,000, and made Lewis Triumph. We know how near the Few of our small Army, who fought, were of Routing the whole Strength of the Grand Monarch. —We know our Troops deserved, tho' they had not Victory.—We now praise their Valour, but the French do more.—They dread it.

IN the Name of GOD, How can our Government, or our General act? — If we had not sent Troops to Flanders to convince the World we were hearty in the Cause, and in some Measure, to persuade the Dutch into our Sentiments, what a Load of Scandal would have issued from the Press.? — If our General had tamely look'd on, and not attempted the Relief of TOURNAY, would not every scribling Fellow pour down from his Garret as much Abuse, as they now Honour him

with for acting otherwise?—Oh! But we were repulsed at FONTENOY, and have lost Flanders.—What then?—If we argue from Consequences, we had best never Begin, because we can never End. — In War, as in Law, Trade, and every other human Project, it suffices, that the Motive of Action was founded in Reason, Justice and Honour; but as to the Consequences, we must submit to the Disposer of all Things.
KING WILLIAM and Queen ANNE'S Wars had the same Rise. Perhaps that Glorious Monarch deserved as much Praise in his Defeats, as the Great Marlborough received for his Victories. The King did not escape Calumny: —Marlborough had his Share;— was disgraced, and even exiled for Conquering!
LET us cast our Eyes round Europe, even in Times of Peace, and shall we not find them all arm'd, and greatly arm'd;— and shall we supinely rest content, and pay no Regard to our Safety? —Tho' some affect to call our Regiments a Standing Army, though the Whole is little more than a French Grand Guard, yet we dread from it the Loss of our Liberty. — Thank God! I have a good Estate, but were our Army double their

Numbers, I would not sell my Land for a Shilling less. — All Europe think our Property, consequently our Liberty, quite secure; otherwise they would never trust their Millions in our Funds.—This is the Touch-stone of our Credit and Character Abroad.—This is the Barometer of the State.—Whilst our Officers are Natives, whilst they are Men of Family and Fortune, and have their Share in the common Blessing, I think I may positively pronounce our Liberty is safe.—Not to speak in too peremptory a Manner, I will allow, that an Army, little or great, is a very useless, nay a dangerous Thing, without Experience and the strictest Discipline; but God forbid they should ever acquire that Experience in their own Country!—Since Experience is absolutely necessary, where ought they learn it but Abroad?
IN our private Capacities we must keep our Honour and preserve our Reputation, even sometimes at the Hazard of our Lives; but who would not hazard more, if possible, when his Property, his Family, and every Thing dear to him, are trampled upon! — A Nation, in this, is as a private Man.—We ought to acquire Reputation, but be careful to keep it.—We

must make ourselves respected, but, by good Conduct, preserve that Dignity.— We ought to love Peace, but by a constant Readiness for War, be able to maintain the one with Honour, or pursue the other with Justice and Glory.
A WORD more, and I have done. I know what Sir John means by German Dominions. Without entring into what, perhaps, none of us rightly understands, I really imagine that a Monarch has some small Title to the natural Liberty of other Men, and may be allowed the same natural Inclinations. I am asham'd this Argument is so often thrown out.— Could I divest myself of the Duty I owe him as my Sovereign, I should still respect and honour his Justice and Valour, were he but a private Gentleman. Let us not, my Friends, foolishly and wantonly condemn, but let us rather endeavour to make his Life Happy and Content, whilst Heaven is pleased to spare him to us. Let us, as free Subjects, Love him, and imitate those, over whom he is Absolute by the Laws, but over whose Hearts, his Clemency and Uprightness has established a more absolute Sway.


SIR JOHN has given me the Text, but the Conclusion I must borrow from the

Doctor.— From what has been said, God grant us a right Understanding, and that we may think on, and practise it, in our Life and Conversation.
AMEN, cry'd the Doctor, with all my Heart. I think the Colonel has given us an excellent Discourse, and very much open'd my Eyes.'—'I must own, said Sir John, we are a little too divided, and make great Drawbacks on our real Happiness, yet, perhaps, this Sort of Conduct poises the Scale of Liberty, and prevents Power and Ambition destroying the Equilibre.


* * *
MR. CONYERS examin'd the Plan of France, as laid down by Mr. Villeneuf, in which he made many Alterations, and the next Evening's Conversation happening to turn on the Subject of the last, — I beg, said he, to be permitted to add a Postscript to the Colonel's Lecture, and to carry you to the Fountain-head of, what I imagine, the Liberty of England.



WHOEVER, continued he, considers the Dominions of France, will imagine they ought not to think of enlarging their Boundaries beyond the Pyranees, the Alps, and the Rhine, as such Conquests would be rather expensive than serviceable.—

Their Views, with regard to Commerce, have always been traversed by England and Holland.—The Forces they constantly keep up, prevent their being disturbed by their Neighbours on the Continent.— By the vast Sums they employ in Foreign Courts, besides their known Subsidies, they fortify themselves with the strongest Alliances.—As they have nothing to fear at Home, they have but one Thing to wish for Abroad, to accomplish all their Schemes.—Could the Austrian Netherland be annexed to France, the grand Project would execute itself.
For this essential Conquest Treasures must be hoarded, Troops must be maintain'd, and no Expence spared. When this finishing Blow can be once struck, France need not desire Universal Monarchy.—If she now maintains three hundred thousand Men, she will then content herself with a Quarter of that Number. —When Mistress of the ten Provinces of Flanders, the Dutch must act as she shall direct.—When assured no War can disturb her Frontiers, what Vessels will she not build!— How many Thousands will then be employ'd at Sea! and, who will she have to oppose her but England?— Their whole Force will then be center'd on the Ocean.— Cast your Eyes on the

Map of Europe.—Will she not then have the whole Coast from Ostend to St. Jean de Luz, besides That in the Mediterranean?—She may then, without aiming at Universal Monarchy, guide, direct, and give Laws to every State in Europe, free from the Trouble of being Sovereign of it.—What would her Glory be, to have MONARCHS for her VASSALS!
IT is next to a mathematical Demonstration, that this is the favourite Project of France. LEWIS the Fourteenth attempted it, and became formidable at Sea, even to the United Fleets of England and Holland, Great and Mighty as they were!— In all human Probability, Lewis had seen the End of his Wishes, had not KING WILLIAM and QUEEN ANNE gloriously interposed and saved Europe. They cut him out such warm Work on the Continent, and obliged him so to waste the Blood and Treasure of his People, that his Sinews at last relaxed, his darling Marine was neglected, and his whole Force became little enough to defend the Heart of his Kingdom.

IF what I have said be not critically the Views of France, they have certainly Schemes of some Affinity to it.—In the present War they practised another Method to arrive at the same End.—They

attack'd the Empire. — Could they have cut off the Head, they knew the Limbs would fall of Course.
SUCH, Gentlemen, I apprehend, is the Fundamental Maxim of France. — To traverse and frustrate such a pernicious Project, Half our Blood and Treasure would be a cheap Purchase. — Our Annals are sanguin'd with the Blood of Britons slaughtered by Brother Britains.— They shew the horrid Devastation of Civil War. — They point out the bloody Fields in England, Scotland and Ireland! —Wherefore all this, but to establish and preserve us in that Liberty we so happily enjoy, but of which some make unworthy Use! — If we have fought with, dethroned, and put our own Monarchs to Death, for infringing on our Liberties, What should we not do to avoid Servility being imposed on us by Foreign Tyranny? ULTIMA RATIO REGUM is the Motto of French Cannon.—If that be the last Argument of the Most Christian Monarch, certainly it is our Duty and Business, as perfectly to understand that Logick.

NOTHING is so dangerous as to contemn an Enemy, and nothing is so idle and vain as to despise and abuse the French.—On the contrary, we ought, and

we have Reason, to dread their Power,— their Situation, and their Politicks.—If we mean to hand down to our Posterity, pure and undefiled, that sacred Liberty purchased by our Ancestors, let us rouze our Spirits, let us unite, and act like them!—But, if we mean to suffer that holy Light to be extinguish'd— to perish with our own frail Bodies, let us not only disband our trivial Land, but likewise our mighty naval Forces; for, except our utmost Strength be collected, and the Designs of France render'd abortive, The ONE will be useless at Home, and, I will venture to prophesy, The OTHER will soon be over-match'd Abroad.


I SHALL conclude with the Words of King William, which ought to be engraven on the Hearts of every True Englishman.' — "Let me conjure you, said that Glorious Monarch, to disappoint the only Hopes of our Enemies by your Unanimity. I have shewn, and will always shew, how desirous I am to be the Common Father of all my People; do you, in like Manner, lay aside Parties and Divisions; let there be no other Distinction heard of amongst us for the future, but of those who are for the PROTESTANT RELIGION, and the PRESENT ESTABLISHMENT, and of

those who mean a POPISH PRINCE, and a FRENCH GOVERNMENT.


IT is not easy to paint the serious Countenances of the Company. The Colonel lifted up his Eyes; Sir John and 'Squire Ash shook their Heads, the Doctor cry'd, Lord have Mercy upon us! but Mr. Leatherhead was so affected, that he let fall his Pipe, and seem'd to neglect his favourite Tankard.
* * *
THE Conversation was on various Subjects, and at last fell on the Laws of England.—The Colonel own'd they were wise and wholesome; but declar'd, that the vast Delay and Chicanerie of the Practitioners was the greatest Burthen a Nation could groan under.— Speedy Justice, said Mr. Conyers, is the Spirit and Essence of Laws both Civil and Criminal. A French Author of Humour observes, "That the English are infinitely more tenacious of their Properties than their Lives; for, says he, Life or Death is generally decided in Twenty-four Hours; but Property, be it ever so trivial, may employ as many Years.

MR. CONYERS was proceeding on the Subject, when the Terror of the Poor, in the Shape of John Clinch the Constable,

enter'd the Room. — Please your Worships, said he, an't please you, there's Moll Stevens has gotten her Belly up, and so, an't please your Worships, as the Wench lays the Matter on Paddy Murphy the Irish Drawer below Stairs, I thoughten best to bring her before your Worships that she might swear it, for, please your Worships, that Irish Dog does a Power of Mischief in the Parish.' — 'Why, Friend, said the Colonel, we do not meet here for Business, but, however, let her come up. — When the Constable withdrew,—Give me Leave, Gentlemen, said the Doctor, to examine this Affair, and to beg of you to do exactly like me, for I want to try an Experiment.—They promis'd, and then enter'd the Constable, Moll Stevens, Paddy Murphy, the Master and Mistress of the House, and most of the Servants.

THE Staff-Officer produc'd the Bible, and very learnedly began to open the Cause; but the Doctor stopp'd him saying, Pray, Friend, hold your Peace: You have nothing to say in the Affair, and I charge you all to keep Silence.—Come hither, young Woman, said he, Don't tremble.—We shall do you no Harm.— You are here to swear to the Person who

has greatly injur'd you in your Reputation, and brought you into some Disgrace.—Do you know, Child, the Nature of an Oath? — Poor Molly Stevens, with downcast Looks, and faultering Tongue, answer'd—Yes—Consider, young Woman, said the Doctor, that an Oath is the only Security between Man and Man. —Consider that an Oath is a solemn Affirmation in the Presence of Almighty God, that what we speak is the Truth, and stake our precious Souls on it.—Consider the Situation you are now in, and that you must, very speedily, be put to a Tryal, where your Life will be in Danger.—To swear falsely, and, perhaps, in a few Days be called to Judgment, is a Thought that should make every Creature tremble. — Consider seriously, my Child, that God will punish Sinners, therefore, be certain of the Truth, and do not rashly risk your Soul, and add a Crime of the blackest Dye, to the Crime, that, by Repentance, God Almighty may forgive.—Be resolute, and say the Truth.— Tears flow'd very plentifully down poor Molly's Cheeks; but the Doctor, taking off his Hat, and kneeling down, all the Company did the same.—In this Posture, he gave her the Book, and administer'd the

Oath in the most solemn Manner, and then rose up.—Now, Child, said he, you are bound to answer with Truth.—Is this young Man, whose Name is Patrick Murphy, the Father of the Child you now go with, or not?' — With many Sobbs and Tears she, at last, answered—No— Who then, said he, is the Father of it?— She hesitated for some Time, and with great Difficulty, answer'd — John Clinch.— Who was it, said the Doctor, that did advise, and would have persuaded you to swear falsely against Patrick Murphy.
She answer'd — John Clinch. — Very well, said he, your Affair is finished — But for you, Mr. Constable, it is my Orders, that you find good Security by To-morrow Morning, for the Maintenance of the Child; and that you immediately pay One Guinea to Patrick Murphy, or I will have you indicted for Subornation of Perjury.

THE Constable, tho' vastly confounded, had so much Wit that he paid his Fine, and the extra Company withdrew, triumphing with Murphy, and applauding the Wisdom of the Parson.—Doctor, said the Colonel, I wish you Joy, for if Perjury be a damning Sin, you have certainly, for this Bout, sav'd one poor Soul.'—'I have often thought, reply'd the Doctor, that we

have not only multiply'd Oaths, and made them familiar, but that our common Way of administring them, is an Inlet to the greatest of Evils, and sincerely wish, that all Justices of the Peace, and other Magistrates, would see it perform'd in a more decent and Christian-like Manner.—Well, well, said Mr. Leatherhead, tho'ff John Clinch be to Father the Child, I believe Irish Paddy has had a Finger in the Pye.—The Son of a Wh—re has a most swinging Brogue, and the Girls begin with Laughing, but he makes some of them Cry for all that. The Fellow makes Love to my Wife's Maid, and I've a Letter of his'n in my Pocket. —Come, said the Colonel, now for an Irish Billet-doux.





My deer Sowl,

WHAT signifis making an Orasion and Palavar, for your one sweet Self no's how despratly i'm in Love with you. My poor I's karryd the Arrant oftin enuf, and your one deer Fese was after givin me a sivil Anser, for you simpurd upon me, and made my poor Hart gump for Joy. Now thees fuu Lines is to ashure my deer charmin Sally, that if she pleses to let me have a smal Confablation, I wil ley my Hart and

Sowl at her Feet, and you may command me by Nite or by Dey for the precent Time, or my hole Life. If you breke my poor Hart I will love you; and when I am in my cowld Greve, my Gost wil attind you, and do you al the Sarvis I can. Ogh! my deer Sally, kepe my Hart allive, and you will find it beter then al the Gosts in England. No more at precent from your fethful and dyin

PATRICK MURPHY.




WELL said, Paddy! cry'd the Colonel, I assure you the young Rogue has got the Laconick Stile, and says a great deal in few Words. In spite of the Brogue on his Pen, you find he comes to the Point, and very likely will carry it.— That he won't, reply'd Mr. Leatherhead, for the Girl hates him, and abuses him all Day long.'—And yet, said Sir John, she may love him all Night.—There have been such Tricks.—'I am in Love, said Mr. Conyers, with this Irish Epistle; but I have one from a Shoemaker in London to my Farmer Tom Driver, whose Son is his Apprentice. As it is a Sample of low Londonshire English, I beg Leave to read it.





Dear Friend,

THESE few Lines is to acquaint you, that your Son Tom is in good Health at this present Writing, and begins to handle his Hammer to some Tune, so that I hopes he'l be a clever Feller. He was in a strange Quandery at the many Fokes in this City, but that Matter is now all off. I'l say that for him, he's the most biggest Boy I ever see of's Age, and as strong as a Bruser: He fitt Will. Adz, the Cooper's Boy and soundly thrash'd his Jackett. He plays a rare Knife and Fork, but can't eat Weeal without Weeneger; but he's very fond of a few Broth. The poor Lad had a Mishap last Week, for he fell out at Wynder, and broke his Head against the Stone Postisses. I find he looks hard at the Wenches, so I fears, he won't be a Batchelder at the End of's Time. Our Friend Mr. Tabby, the Stay-Maker, is now a Wyder. No more from

your loving Frend, TOBY LIFT.





I DON'T see, said Mr. Leatherhead, why we should laugh at the Shoemaker because he don't write so fine as a Parson; tho'ff he don't, he writes well enough, and he's an Englishman; But what a Plague have we to do with a Parcel of

Irish, who take the Bread out of our Mouths, and debauch all our Women? Why don't we transport 'em back to their Bogs and Potato's; I'm sure 'twould be happy for us if Ireland was at the Bottom of the Sea.'—'No, no, said Sir John, not that neither; but I think we ought to give them no Trade, and make them pay some of our Taxes.' — 'That's an odd Maxim, Sir John, said the Colonel:—Now I should think, that the best Way to make them pay some of our Taxes, is to put them in a Condition to do it.— Should we keep them Poor, we may lay on Taxes, but how shall we collect them?—Where shall we find the Money? —'I shall not, said the Doctor, reason on the Prudence or Justice of England, because, tho' Mr. Leatherhead forgets it, I was born in Ireland, and might be suspected of Partiality, but Mr. Conyers has a Letter, with some Account of that Kingdom, which, I own, gave me great Pleasure, because I sincerely love Great-Britain, and honour the King.' — 'The Account, said Mr. Conyers, that the Doctor has mentioned, is a Copy of a Letter from an English Gentleman, to a noble Lord, which fell into my Hands by Accident. If you think proper, it shall make Part of our Entertainment at next Meeting.

* * *
THE Reader will please to remember, that Mr. Villeneuf gave Jack a Paper relating to Ireland. This Paper Mr. Conyers altered, and threw into the Shape of the following Letter, which he read in his Place.





Dublin,
17 March, 1744.

My Lord,

I HAVE now finished my Tour through this Kingdom. In my former Letters I gave your Lordship some Account of Cities and Towns, but rather as a Journal of my Travels, than a regular Description of the Country. I purpose now to speak of the Kingdom in general, and hope I have so much conquered my former unaccountable Prejudices, as to be able to give your Lordship a short but true Idea of Ireland.

IT is of little Moment to argue, whether this Country is claimed by England as a Conquest, or whether the Inhabitants threw themselves under its Protection?—That the Irish fought against Queen Elizabeth, and were often in Arms, till entirely subdued by King William, is a Matter not to be wondered at, when

we consider their Religion. —Erroneous as their Principles were, they certainly acted agreeable to them.—No doubt the Resistance they made, and the Blood they shed, struck that Sort of Horror and Hatred in our Ancestors, that is handed down to their Posterity, and makes, at this Day, Part of our Character.—When we speak of the People, we ought carefully to make a Distinction between Irish and Irish, that is, we ought to regard the Protestants of Ireland as ourselves, because, in Fact, they are our Brethren and our Children; and so to manage the poor Natives, who are mostly Papists, that by Clemency and good Usage we may wean them from ill Habits, and make them faithful and useful Subjects.
THE Settlements of our Ancestors in this Kingdom, and the Number of English that are daily fixing themselves in the Law, the Church, the Army, and in Civil Employments, must in Time make it a Protestant Country, and of the highest Importance to Great-Britain.— An Acquisition of Three Millions of Subjects, and above Ten Millions of good Acres, is not so trivial an Affair as some imagine.— If we have conquered this Kingdom, Who

enjoys the Conquest but the Descendants of the English?—If true Policy requires Lenity and Encouragement to the Conquered, undoubtedly the Conquerors, who settled on the Spot, have at least the same Title.—Wherefore did we conquer but to establish our Laws, our Religion, our Manners, and our Liberty, amongst a People who greatly wanted all, and to add Strength and Lustre, to the Throne of England?—It is true, my Lord, we are Masters of this Kingdom, but I am afraid we do not reap a Tenth of the Advantages it might procure us!
OUR whole Conduct favours too much of Monopoly. We argue from wrong Principles; for every Individual, regardless of every other, measures the Happiness of the Kingdom but by his own private Interest. — Thus, a Cloathing Town complains dreadfully of the Decay of its Trade, without considering how much it increases in another.— Bristol is much out of Humour that the African and Slave-Trade is so considerably fall'n; but Bristol forgets to inform us, how greatly it flourishes at Liverpool.

PROVIDED Trade exists, 'tis indifferent to us, as a Nation, where it fixes; but I apprehend, the more Places it inhabits,

the greater the Chance for its Increasing. —With regard to the Kingdom, I applaud our Wisdom in promoting and encouraging their Linen Manufacture.— Their Industry has brought this Branch to infinite perfection, which alone enables them to pay so great a Tax to England as Twelve Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year.—Your Lordship will be surprised at my Mentioning a Tax.—If the express Letter will not allow of the Term, the real Fact will justify it.—The Pensions and Employments on this Establishment, the large Fortunes spent in England, the great Importation of English Commodities, with other Articles that are exactly computed, will amount to that Sum, if not to more.
DID they want this Linen Trade, England, would want so much clear Profit, and Silesia, Hamburgh and Holland, enjoy the Sweets. Your Lordship therefore perceives, how much it is the Interest of England, to cherish and countenance this Branch. Should we neglect or clog it by partial Views, or unseasonable Parsimony, we should irrecoverably lose a Mine more valuable than that of Gold. Whilst we favour Ireland in this, it is but Just and Right we would be equally

kind to our Brethren of Scotland. The Field is wide enough for both, and both ought to be supported by every Bounty we can bestow.
WHAT Laws have we not made, what Expence have we not been at, to prevent the Exportation of Irish Wooll into Foreign Nations! — Has it answered the End proposed?—I am sure it has not— The natural Consequence of our Prohibition is, that they send, it by Stealth into France, where they have a certain Vent.— Is this clandestine Trade practised in England?—I fear your Lordship cannot answer in the Negative.
IRELAND could do extremely well without French Wines; but I know not the Inconveniencies France would be drove to, had she not their Beef, their Tallow, Hides and Butter; but when we add Wooll, the Irish have a Profit in that Commodity; the French have a vast Gain, but the English are as certainly vast Losers.—Were your Lordship to examine strictly into the Truth, you would find that the grand Contest is not so much between England and Ireland, but between England and France. Your Lordship would then discover, that every Link we throw out to bind Ireland, not

only curtails their Profits but our own, and, what is worse, transferring those Profits into the Arms of France.—Was this Matter seriously considered, and it is worth the Thoughts of the wisest amongst us, Abbeville would soon be a Desart, and the French obliged to recur to the old Method of buying our Stuffs.
AND here, my Lord, permit me to lay open a Piece of French Conduct, which is not generally known. Abbeville is a Royal Manufacture: To support which, Wooll must be obtained from England and Ireland at any Price, but the Manufacturers pay only the middle Price of England, and the King, that is, the Kingdom in general, pays the Remainder. By this Method, and by the Cheapness of Provisions, they are able to undersell us in foreign Markets.
AMONGST the many Schemes for restraining Irish Wooll, I have met but with one that in any Degree can answer the End. — The Author proposes a large Bounty on the Exportation of Corn from Ireland.—This, says he, would certainly throw the Inhabitants into Tillage, and soon convert their Sheep Walks into Corn Fields, and all the People would be properly employed and supported.

WERE your Lordship to view the Southern and Western Coasts of this Kingdom, you would be as much charmed with their Bays and Harbours, as astonished to find them of such little Use.—Little to themselves, but less to England.— Were it possible to convince Gentlemen, that, let the Riches of Ireland be what it will, Nine Tenths would certainly center in England, I imagine they could not hesitate a Moment, but, by endeavouring to increase it, at the Expence of our Enemies, enable them, at last, to bear a Proportion, and to contribute to the Exigencies of the British Government.

THE common Opinion of the Laziness of the Irish, is not strictly Just. The Negroes in America have certainly more comfortable Dwellings, and are better fed than the poor Natives of this Country. They are Strangers to Property, as well as Meat. With what Spirit would an English Plowman work under such Circumstances? — I fancy not much better than the Irish.—If these poor People are Slothful and Inactive, their Food will account for it, on the same Principles that Sir William Temple accounts for the peculiar Courage of the English.—No doubt, my Lord, but good Nourishment, good

Cloaths, and decent Habitations, greatly Influence the Constitution of a Man, and give a Labourer that Vigour and Life so necessary to his Employment.—Your Lordship may ask, Why it is not so in Ireland? — The Error, I think, lies in the Generality of the Landlords. Here, a Man of large Fortune never sees his Estate, and will not be troubled with a Multiplicity of Tenants. — He lets the Whole to a few Gentlemen.—These, lett their Parts to others, reserving a certain Revenue to themselves.—These again do the same in a lower Degree, till, by passing thro' a Dozen, or Twenty Hands, it sinks the real Occupiers into downright Misery and Wretchedness.—As a Man of some Humanity and Tenderness for my Fellow Creatures, I most heartily wish I could as easily Point out the Remedy, as shew the Disease.

NOTWITHSTANDING their own capital Errors, and many of ours, they seem to struggle through Difficulties with great Resignation and Patience. They spare no Pains to make it a Protestant Kingdom, and most vigorously follow the Plan laid down, at a vast Expence, by Dr. HENRY MAUL, now Bishop of Meath, in educating the Children of the Natives

in Labour, Industry and true Religion. Already have they reclaimed Thousands of unhappy Creatures, and added them to the Stock of faithful Subjects.—If the Romans granted a Civic Crown to him who saved one Citizen, what Triumphs, what Statues does not this truly Right Reverend Prelate deserve, for preserving such Multitudes!—The Reward of this World can be but Praise; the just Recompence can only be given in the other.—I inclose to your Lordship a full Account of this most noble and useful Charity, now founded on a Charter.

ONE rational Scheme produces others. —Their liberal Subscriptions for encouraging Husbandry, Arts, Manufactures, and, in short, every Branch of Industry and useful Knowledge, betrays not an idle, inactive Spirit, and the Consequence is visible throughout the whole Kingdom. — I send your Lordship a List of Premiums for the present Year. Add this to the Account of the Charter Schools, and they give such a Proof of true Wisdom and Understanding, that I am not able to cite any Thing that even looks like a Parallel.
YOUR Lordship will not expect Encomiums on the Papists of this Kingdom

for their firm Attachment to a Protestant Government. No, my Lord, but they are quiet and amenable to it. As for the Protestants, I am convinced his Majesty has not more loyal and faithful Subjects.

THE Ridicule on the Irish Tone, or Manner of Speaking, is rather more absurd than barbarous. All Nations have that Folly. — The Parisians make very free with the Normans, Gascoigns, and other Provinces. — The People of Rome banter the common Venetian Dialect.— The Saxons despise the Tone of other German States. — All Germany laugh at the Low Dutch, and the Hollanders laugh as heartily at the Flemings.—Each Country in England make themselves merry at the Expence of another; but all England ridicule the Scotch, Welch and Irish, and these, I suppose, return the Compliment.— Thus we have all the lucky Faculty of finding Perfection in ourselves, and seeing the Contrary in our Neighbours.
WHATEVER might have been the Reason for holding the Irish in Contempt, even to Hatred, I can truly say, those Reasons must have long since ceased. They are now Members, and very useful Members to our Body, and are capable of being made infinitely more so. They

are not, as some imagine, a Wen on the Neck of England, that disgraces our Form, and sucks up our natural Juices. No, my Lord; but as it certainly is in our Power to make them so, it is as certain that we may and ought to render them a Strength and a Support to the British Government.

I CANNOT let slip an Opportunity of expressing my Gratitude for the many Civilities I have received in this Country. Hospitality is their Character. Indeed they a little exceed in the Article of Wine, especially in Brimmers, to the Cause of Liberty and our happy Constitution. Their Zeal is so fervent, that they forget that the Wine they drink is of that Country that would destroy both.

LET us, my Lord, avoid all invidious Names and Distinctions, and rank them amongst the Errors of the Vulgar. Let us be just and faithful to each other. Let us learn Truth, Wisdom and Honour. These are not confined to the Torrid or Frigid Zone, neither can temperate Regions boast their peculiar Residence.


I am, with the greatest Respect, My Lord, &amp;c.






CHAP. X.


Where, where, degen'rate Countrymen—how high,
Will your fond Folly and your Madness fly?
Are Scenes of Death, and servile Chains so dear
To sue for Blood and Bondage every Year,
Like Rebel Jews, with too much Freedom curst,
To court a Change,—tho' certain of the worst?

GARTH.



I AM afraid I have carried my Reader too far from the Subject-Matter of this History, and try'd his Patience; but I assure him that my Indulgence has been very great; for, at infinite Pains, I have curtail'd the last Chapter at least Sixty Pages. —Few know the Difficulty of Bridling the Imagination, and Reining back an hard-mouth'd Pen. It sometimes gets a-head, and, in Spite of all our Skill, runs away with us into Mire and Dirt; nay, this Minute I find my Quill in a Humour to gallop, so shall stop him short in Time.
THUS we have seen the agreeable Manner Mr. Conyers pass'd away many Evenings; and thus did he establish himself in

the Affections of his Company, and in the Love of the Inhabitants, by many Acts of generous Charity. Colonel Manly, in particular, held him in great Esteem, and carried his Friendship so far, as to promise his Interest with the Borough for a Seat in Parliament on the first Vacancy.
MR. CONYERS had now experienced perfect Happiness for above a Year.—He knew the great Secret of enjoying the good Things of this World, so as not to abuse them.—His Fortune, his faithful and agreeable Companion, his Family, and the Love and Respect of all, were the Rewards of his honest Intentions to all Mankind. In a Word, the Elements in him were so mix'd, that he deserv'd the honourable Title of a Man.— But this World is not made for permanent and lasting Joys! — His Happiness, Tranquillity, and every domestick Pleasure, vanish'd in a Moment, and left him as awaken'd out of a Dream of Bliss.—He had a Prospect of an Increase to his Happiness, but the Disappointment added to his Pains.
MRS. CONYERS was near Lying-in, but an ignorant Servant Maid telling her a most frightful Story of the Rebellion, which had just then broke out, threw her into a Fit and violent Tremor, which brought

on an improper Labour. She was delivered of a Boy, who died soon after, and in four Days the kind, the tender, the affectionate and agreeable Mrs. Conyers, follow'd her Child.
THE Distraction and real Grief of the Family and their Friends is not to be express'd. Mr. Conyers bore this dreadful Stroke like a Man, but he felt it like a Man. His Exclamations were few, but his Sighs and the Throbbings of his Heart were without Number. His inky Coat was not the only Sign of Sorrow. The involuntary Tear, the Heavings of his Breast, and the Alteration of his Countenance, gave visible Marks of sincere Affliction.—Let me at once quit the melancholy Subject, and bring my Friend to a State of Mind a little more composed and resigned.—He assured Mr. and Mrs. Sampson of his constant Affection and Love, and that notwithstanding his dearest Wife had made no Will, he knew her Intention, and would fulfil it. Accordingly, new Writings were drawn, and he made them a Compliment of Three thousand Pounds.

HIS gloomy Countenance would have had a much longer Duration, had not the Rebellion rous'd his Indignation. He thought his Duty to his Sovereign call'd him from

Inaction, and the Love of his Country seem'd prior to every other Regard. To bestow hard Names on Rebels, and supinely to sigh at intestine War, he judg'd, was unmanly and imprudent. He had no Idea, that the Choice of Liberty or Slavery requir'd a Moment's Hesitation. Full of Freedom and Glory, he unbosom'd his Thoughts to the Colonel. — My dear Friend, said this venerable but hearty old Gentleman, I must love you the more for this.—Yes, my dear Conyers, go — fight for your Country, and God Almighty preserve and give you Victory!— Did my great Age permit, I would be your Companion, and share in the Danger.—I well remember, tho' then a Boy, the Insolence of a Popish Government. I remember the Seven Bishops in the Tower. —The Swarms of Friers in St. James's Park.— The Sham Liberty of Conscience, and a thousand other Enormities. — Young as I was, I follow'd my Father, and join'd the Prince of Orange.—I fought and bled for him and Liberty at the Boyne. —I fought for Liberty and KING GEORGE at Dumblain, and what Man, who has a Soul, and a Sense of our invaluable Blessings, but would venture, nay lay down his Life for them?— Now I am Old and Infirm, but my Heart is good, —indeed

it is—The poor Gentleman could proceed no farther, for Tears choak'd his Words. Mr. Conyers was greatly affected, and said all in his Power to ease the Colonel's Heart.— You must forgive, said the Colonel, the Weakness of an old Man.— I cannot help it.—But, when I think on Times past,—On the Danger our Constitution has, so often, been in, and the noble and successful Struggles we have made to defend it.—When I think on these Things, my Pulse forgets its Age, and beats as strong as in Youth.—Good God!—What is it we want!—Is there a reasonable Blessing that we do not, or may not enjoy! — Are we blind to our own Happiness, and can some, who call themselves Protestants, even think of a Popish King but with Horror?—Can we be so stupid as not to see the old, the stale Trick of France? And must some of us always fall into so weak a Project?—Poor deluded Men! But thank God, we have still Honour and Wisdom sufficient to convince them of their Errors.


FROM my Soul I wish it, reply'd Mr. Conyers, neither have I the least Doubt. —For my Part, I am determin'd, and will immediately prepare for the Field.— I believe, said the Colonel, I can assist

you.—Let me see—Ay—I have a Tent, and every Camp-Necessary, in good Order, for I frequently visit them to refresh my Memory. — These are your's, with two excellent Baggage Horses, and a Baw-Man that understands his Business. —Dear Sir, said Mr. Conyers, you have made me quite happy.—I am already in the Field. — Softly, softly, answer'd the Colonel, perhaps I may do somewhat more. I would not have you go with Irregulars, for it will not be so Satisfactory.—A Noble Duke is about raising a Regiment of HORSE.—He does me the Honour to rank me with his intimate Friends, and I will immediately send an Express, and write him such a Letter, that, perhaps, shall put you in a Light of Honour, and enable you to be really useful.
—Mr. Conyers return'd him many Thanks, and he was exact to his Promise.

WE must now, said the Colonel, think of engaging a few good Volunteers to accompany you to the Regiment, in case you succeed. We must be busy, and go roundly to work. — In a few Days they fix'd on twenty young Fellows, mostly Sons of Tenants. — In a short Time the Colonel received a most polite and obliging Answer to his Letter. It concluded—

From the great Character you give Mr. Conyers, he cannot fail of being extremely agreeable. I am sorry I have but a Lieutenancy to offer him. Should this be accepted of, I beg an Answer by Express, and that he would join the Regiment at ***** with all Speed, with whatever good Men he can pick up.


LIEUTENANT Conyers, said the Colonel, I most heartily wish you Joy.—Now indeed Matters put on a better Face, and you are equipp'd as you ought to be.— But, Bustle, Bustle.—Take Leave of the good People at Home; make your Will, and—To Horse and away.


TAKING Leave, was a Task he could wish to be excus'd, but it was impossible. Mr. Sampson was struck Dumb at the News, but his good Wife lost all Patience. She could not comprehend the Necessity of his going in Person, when he might by Deputy. She quoted many Examples of Gentlemen, of Fortunes infinitely superior to his, who contented themselves with paying a little Money, and drinking Success to the Cause.—Yes, yes, my Dear, said her Husband, they must be special good Subjects, who are only warm in the Cause, by the Quantity of Liquor they drink. I violently suspect such Sort of People, and

am not sorry to find my dear Brother of another Way of Thinking. I am only concern'd that such an unhappy Occasion should deprive us of his Company, and throw him into Danger; but I trust in God, he will return in Safety and with Victory.'—If he must go, reply'd Mrs. Sampson, I pray God to protect and shield him.—The Conversation became more familiar, and by degrees he persuaded them to excuse the Ceremony of Parting, which would give Pain, and make him miserable.
WITH all imaginable Diligence he prepared for his Departure. He sent forward twenty-three Recruits under the Care of two of his Tenants. He left a Will with Dr. Grace, and a Power with Mr. Sampson to receive his Rents, and remitted Five Hundred Pounds to the Agent of the Regiment, that he might draw on him as Occasions required. He concerted Matters with the Colonel, and his Horses and Baggage filed off by Degrees to the next Town. He invited some Friends to Dinner the next Day, which was Sunday; so the Family was sure of him for one Meal more. However, whilst they were at Church, the Colonel called in his Chariot and accompany'd him, where the Horses

attended. The old Gentleman gave him a proper Letter to his Grace, and stay'd with him that Night. In the Morning he took a Soldier-like Farewell; saw him set out for the Regiment, and return'd in the Evening to give Mr. Sampson an Account of their Expedition.

Since great Examples justify Command,
Let glorious Acts more glorious Acts inspire,
And catch, from Breast to Breast, the noble Fire.

POPE'S HOMER.



OUR Lieutenant soon arrived at the appointed Place, and found his Recruits in good Order. He was received with great Politeness, and presented with his Commission, and to all his Brother-Officers. The Regiment was near compleat, and only waited the General's Orders to march where the Service required. He was extremely pleased with this New Society, as he found the Officers were not only Gentlemen of Good Sense, but of considerable Fortunes. He readily joined in every Expence that was proposed to make the Regiment

live comfortably, and do Honour to the Cause.
IN about three Weeks he received a Letter from Colonel Manly, with some Books. The Letter is so concise, and so full of good Instruction, that I cannot avoid giving it a Place verbatim.




My very dear Friend,

I TAKE this first Opportunity of fulfilling my Promise, by laying before you what my Age and Experience judge necessary for your Well-doing.
YOU are a Man of Property, and now enlisted to fight the Cause of Freedom, and of That MONARCH who has ever supported it.—You are a Soldier. You are one of those on whom, under God, the Life and Liberty of this Nation depend. —Consider the Dignity of your Station.— Consider the mighty Trust reposed in you. Consider yourself, and it is scarcely possible you will err in your Conduct.
I AM positive as to your personal Courage, for your Soul is humane and tender, and your Tongue is not a Bragart; but as your Behaviour in this new Scene of Life is what I am not so certain of, your Good-nature will excuse a little Advice, and attribute my Trite Maxims, more

to the Warmth of my Friendship, than to any Occasion you may have for them.
TO be an Officer, there is no Necessity of being inspired with supernatural Talents. Common Sense, and the Deportment of a Gentleman are sufficient. The Knowledge of your Duty, and the Military Art, will come with Time and Experience; but a close Application to the Study is necessary.
THE Love of the Soldiers is the Happiness of an Officer; and to gain that Love, the Method is short and easy.— Pay and punish where due, but never strike. — Be free with your Men, but suffer them not to be too free with you. An haughty, over-bearing Temper, may indeed inspire them with Fear, but never with Affection. Treat them as Men, and they will respect you as their Officer; but at the same Time, be careful that the Non-commission'd Officers act in the same Manner, and support their proper Authority, on which all Duty and Submission depends.
ENDEAVOUR, as much as possible, to keep your Men clean and decent; it gives Spirits, and prevents Drunkenness and Debauchery. — Drop in at their Meals,

taste their Victuals, encourage them to keep good Messes, and reprove where you find them remiss.
BE assiduous to learn the Exercise of a Soldier, and keep your Men diligent at it, yet so as not to fatigue them unnecessarily. See that they punctually obey your Commands, but be not too rigorous in trivial Matters. Believe me, the Men soon find out the Genius of their Officers, and will never impose or play Tricks, when they know they cannot do it with Impunity.

MAKE it a constant Rule to obey with Alacrity and Chearfulness every Order of your Superiors: Such a Conduct will add to your Reputation, and confirm your Character.

SLANDER and Scandal sometimes insinuate themselves into Camps, and too frequently attack the most Deserving. Let me beg of you to turn the deaf Ear to evil Report, and not be speedily prejudiced against any Man, much less your Commanders.
IF an Officer need not have all the Wisdom of a Privy-Counsellor, he ought, at least, to have that Part that enjoins Secrecy. The Spanish Proverb is good:— In a closed Mouth no Flies enter.—Execute

your Orders in Silence, and let not the most distant Hint, of the Conduct of the Army, escape from your Lips or your Pen. Should you know nothing particular, your Words must be mere Conjecture, and, in all Probability, quite wrong. Should a material Circumstance come to your Knowledge, what Infamy must follow your disclosing it!
COMPANY and Chearfulness are absolutely necessary, but to drink to Excess is inexcusable. The Lives of Thousands depend on the Sobriety of Officers.—How can a Drunkard guide Men truly, when his own Legs mutiny, and refuse his Commands?
BE charitable; be generous according to your Power; but seldom give Money to a Soldier. When you think proper to Reward or Encourage, there are other Ways infinitely more useful to them.
RISE early, and examine your Command; keep them reasonably employ'd, and under the strictest Discipline; but let your own Example keep Pace with your Precepts. Have all your Affairs in so nice and exact an Order, as to be always ready to march at a Moment's Warning. All Men ought to accustom themselves

to Regularity; but none requires it more than a Soldier.

YOUR natural good Temper will prevent your giving Offence to any One, and perhaps incline you to bear patiently those offered to you; but have a Care, and let what will be the Consequence, permit no Man to Taunt or Insult—Should the least Particle of Contempt fall on you, quit a Service, where you must do more Harm than Good.

WITH regard to your present Enemies, hold them not too cheap.—Speak of them as Men of an unhappy Education, led away by false Maxims, and prejudiced to erroneous Principles: They are, or ought to be, our Brethren.—Let your Humanity extend to them as far as Safety and Prudence will permit. If absolute and fatal Necessity compels you to strike, let the Sword fall from no other Motive but the General Good. — Let it be effectual, but instant. — In that unhappy Case drive every Womanish Weakness from your Heart, and consider, that too much Lenity and Tenderness may be Cruelty to your Country.—The Action, or necessary Pursuit over, let Clemency and Compassion fill your Breast.—Should you conquer, be all Mildness and Charity. —Comfort the

Prisoner; assist the wretched Wounded; speak Peace to despairing Souls, and, if possible, shew them the Joys of Freedom and Liberty.

But I have done, and discharged the Office annexed to Love and Friendship. If my Hints are useless to you, perhaps you may know those to whom they may be of Service.
I SEND you my old faithful Companion Monsieur de Feuquiere. Read him carefully, for he is able to instruct. I likewise send you Polibius, with the Annotations of Monsieur de Follard.

YOU find I am an old Fellow by my long-winded Tale; but I shall appear more so, when you consider I end, (where I ought to have begun) by recommending to you the Service of God, and Obedience to his Ordinances. A Righteous and a Godly Life is the best Preparative for Death. Tho' all ought, yet none should be more ready to obey that Call than a Soldier.—His Life is every Instant, in a peculiar Manner, at Stake.—Think on this frequently, and your Duty to God and Man will certainly follow; and Man and the Almighty will reward you with Peace, Content and Happiness.—Into his Hands I resign you, and most fervently

pray him to crown your Cause with Victory, and to continue his Mercy to this Land to latest Posterity.


I am, my dear Conyers,
Your very affectionate and Very faithful Servant, JOSIAH MANLY.



MR. CONYERS was greatly pleased at the Sincerity and Goodness of the Colonel. He read his Letter many Times, and compared it with the Instructions of Mr. Kindly, with a determin'd Resolution of adhering to both as far as he was able. He read Feuquiere and Polibius with Pleasure, but Monsieur de la Colonie, and the Maxims of Turenne, afforded equal Instruction and Delight.



CHAP. XII.


Whither, Oh! whither do you madly run,
The Sword unsheath'd, and impious War begun?
What Land, what Wave of boundless Neptune's Flood
Hath not been stain'd, alas! with British Blood;
Not that the Rival to the British Fame

Proud France, might tremble at the British Name,
Not that Iberia, tho' unskill'd in War,
In Chains should follow our triumphal Car;
But that Rome's Pontiff should his Vow enjoy,
And Britain, Suicide! herself destroy.

WHY should I take up the Time of the Reader, by going minutely into the Conduct of the Rebels or our own. My Task is only relative to the private Character of Jack Connor, or Mr. Conyers. A Lawyer only speaks from his Brief, and in all those Pages on which this History is founded, I find little or no Traces of the Actions of the Times.—I own I met with

a Paper, that I suppose serv'd as Memorandums and Hints to Mr. Conyers. It was dated like a Journal, but gave me little Insight into Affairs. I find the Words — They slipp'd by — We march'd to — Miss'd again — Slipp'd again — Men much harrass'd —Vastly oblig'd to London Subscription—The Inhabitants of ***** deserve Encouragement, but the City of ***** to be burnt.—Thank God we have got our Troops from Flanders. —The DUKE to command.—Our People in great Spirits.—Victory or Death.—Then follow'd in Capital Letters, CULLODEN 16th APRIL 1746. THEY WERE WEIGH'D IN THE BALLANCE, AND FOUND LIGHT.
WHEN he reflected on the happy Consequences of the Glorious Day.— When he considered, that Freedom, Liberty, Religion, and his Majesty's August Family were more firmly establish'd and confirmed to Great Britain.—That a full Period was put to Blood and Slaughter, and to that unnatural Monster, CIVIL WAR, his Heart exulted, and his Joy was extreme. — He very devoutly returned his Acknowledgments to that Providence, which had so often and so signally preserved our invaluable Privileges, and had protected him in the Midst of so many Dangers.

HE wrote a particular Account of this Battle to Mr. Sampson and Colonel Manly. He vastly extoll'd the Skill and Judgment of the General, and the Valour of the Troops. In his Letter to the Colonel, he has these remarkable Words:

I THINK I see all England in a Joy next to Madness. All admire the Conduct and Intrepidity of his Royal Highness. They cannot now find Words sufficient to express their Praises. But of you, who know the National Infirmity, give me Leave to ask, How long will this last? —Will they not soon be equally eager to strip him of his Laurels?—Will not Envy, Malice, and Disaffection soon endeavour to poison the Minds of the People, and blast the Reputation of Him, who risqued his own to preserve their Lives and Properties?—I fear he must expect such Treatment. I doubt our Gratitude, and most heartily wish, for the Honour of the Kingdom, that I may be deceived. This War, and the Danger of it is over, consequently the Instruments of Safety, will soon be sacrific'd to the Parsimony of their Purse, and every disbanded Soldier exposed to the Insults of every Peasant. — For my own Part, I so much admire the Military Virtues of my Leader,

he shall command my Hand and my Heart, where-ever and as long as he judges proper.

HE greatly commiserated the unfortunate Prisoners, now subject to the injured Laws of their Country. To avert the Punishment due to such Crimes, was not in his Power; but to make them easy, and alleviate their Sorrows, was his daily Employment.—He lay'd no Stress on Victory, as it is an uncertain Determination of Right or Wrong; but he argued in the gentlest Terms, and endeavour'd to convince them, from History, Reason, and Experience, that their Prejudices were ill founded. — That, they were Dupes to the Politicks of France, and acted like Children who disobey the best of Parents.—That as Criminal as they were, his Majesty was cloathed with Mercy, and advised an immediate Application to his Clemency.—He shewed them the Goodness of the late King in 1715, and very judiciously referred them to the Memoirs of Marchal Villars, and many other French Books, for the opposite Conduct of Lewis the Fourteenth to his Protestant Subjects in the Cevennes, who had taken Arms merely to defend their Religion, not to dethrone their Monarch.—Such a Conduct made Mr. Conyers vastly beloved, and brought some,

who were violent, to think with more Moderation. He greatly pity'd the poor Clans, as they were bred up in a blind and implicit Obedience to their Chiefs. He lamented those Gentlemen who acted from Conscience and Principle, but regarded those, as the most wicked of human Beings, whose only Motive was to fish in Troubled Waters.

NOT content with this Sort of Behaviour, he endeavoured to remove our own Prejudices, and take off that Acrimony and Ill-nature, which some of us are too subject to.—He prov'd the Injustice and Cruelty of Branding a whole Kingdom, for the Faults of a Few. That, even those Few were fall'n Brethren, and erred in their Duty, but from their Zeal to mistaken Opinions. That most of them deserved our Pity more than our Anger. That, so far from perpetuating Animosity, all Encouragement and Regard should be shewn to the Good, and every Scheme set on Foot to convert the Bad.— Time and proper Management, would convince every Mortal, that, as a Union of Minds was our reciprocal Interest, so Love and Friendship would soon make us, the affectionate Children of an indulgent Parent.

HAPPY, thrice Happy should we be, if every Man reasoned like Mr. Conyers! — Division and Envy and Malice and Madness would cease to distract and confound the

real Beauty and Harmony of our most excellent Constitution. — Were our Souls cemented by Love, Tenderness and Charity.— Did we take half the Pains to assist, as we do to destroy each other, what Joys would not this Land afford!—With what Respect would Foreign Nations behold us! — What Terror to our Enemies, and to the Disturbers of Europe!

Quoth Hudibras, the Case is clear,
As thou hast proved it by their Practice,
No Argument like Matter of Fact is;
And we are best of all led to
Mens Principles by what they do.

HUDIBRAS.



CERTAINLY it is almost Time to proceed to the personal Account of Lieutenant Conyers, but I must crave a little Indulgence for the following Chapter, and shall then follow him more closely.
AMONGST the Manuscripts so often mentioned, I found one relative to the unhappy Subject of last Chapter. I suppose Mr. Conyers had seen some of the Declarations

published by the Son of the Pretender, which induced him to form one by way of Parody, and by taking off the Mask shew the Picture in a full and just Light.—Whether this Piece was published or not, I cannot learn, but to omit it in this its proper Place, would be unpardonable in a Faithful Historian; to which honourable Title I hope I have a Right.— The Paper runs thus.




THE DECLARATION of —

By Command of our R—l F—; the Divine Permission of his Holiness the Pope; the Assistance of his Most Christian, and the good Wishes of his Most Catholick Majesty, aided and supported by the Alms and Prayers of all true Sons of the Church, we send this our Declaration to the People of England, Greeting.

You must be all convinced, that the unhappy Fate of our Grand-Father King James the Second, (of Glorious and Pious Memory) was owing to the Infidelity and Cowardice of his Fleets and Armies.

AS your Cowardice and Infidelity were the Ruin and Subversion of our august House, we trust hat the same Principles are capable of restoring us to the Throne of our Ancestors.
TO obviate every Difficulty to these our just and laudable Purposes, we shall, by the Authority aforesaid, convince this Nation, that our Rule will be salutary, and extend to the Happiness of every Individual.
THE Riot and Habeas Corpus Acts are equally dangerous, and shall, with the Advice of Friends, be abrogated or suspended, until a Regulation can be made, and the Holy Inquisition introduced into the Kingdom.
AS the Grand and Petty Juries are the greatest Evils of Civil Government, they shall be abolished, and the Judges, whom we shall think proper to appoint, shall finally hear and determine all criminal Causes.
PROCESSES in Civil Affairs are most shamefully and abominably abused. The Decision of Property, as now managed, is a Matter that greatly affects our humane Heart, and until a proper Method can be fixed on for abridging the Laws, we shall take the contested Lands or Property into our Care and Guardianship.

THE Insufficiency of the Statute and Common Law of England absolutely require an Explaining and a Dispensing Power. We shall therefore, once more, establish a Star Chamber-court in its fullest Extent.
THE many Evils arising from Clandestine Marriages is a Scandal to the Nation, and Ruin to many Thousand Families. To remedy which, we shall immediately erect a Court of Wards, as in the Days of our illustrious Ancestors.
THE Education of Youth is a Matter of the highest Importance. Our Vigilance shall watch over those mighty Seminaries Oxford and Cambridge. Their Learning is too crampt and confined, but by the Assistance of Mandamuses, we shall throw in such Fellow Labourers from the Sorbonne and St. Omers, as will soon inculcate our grand Design.
LIBERTY is the greatest Blessing Man can enjoy; but the Abuse of that Liberty the greatest Curse: To avoid the latter, and yet keep strictly to the former, it is our sincere and determin'd Resoluion, to indulge every Man in the peaceable and quiet Liberty of THINKING. Nevertheless, tho' we would shew our great Moderation and Lenity, our true Intent and

Meaning is, That should any Person presume to do more than merely THINK, he shall not only incur our highest Displeasure, but be delivered to the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, over whom we do not pretend to have any Power, consequently the Door of our natural Clemency will be shut against him.
FROM our unbounded Charity to weak and tender Minds, and in Imitation of our illustrious Grandfather, (of blessed Memory) it is our firm Resolution to grant a plenary Indulgence and full Liberty of Conscience to all Sects and Religions whatsoever; that they shall exercise and enjoy all their respective Rites and Ceremonies in the amplest Manner, until the true and infallible Church has taken Root, and spread its Branches, but no longer.

THE Liberty of the Press is an Abomination in the Sight of God and Man. Such Power in the Hands of Unbelievers and Hereticks, gave Rise to vile Writings and Infinity of Blasphemies against the most Highest; nay, it has dared to open its Mouth against the Majesty of Kings: — To contemn and make odious that great Bulwark of Monarchy, The ancient System of Divine, Hereditary and indefeasible

Right of Princes and Potentates; — To stir up the Rabble against that mild and peaceable Doctrine of Non-Resistance and Passive Obedience;—To undermine all the Ordinances of our Holy Mother Church; — To reproach us with Idolatry, Cruelty and Superstition; and above all, it has been so wicked, to set before the Vulgar and Ignorant the whole Works of the Prophets and Apostles, without the Aid of Hebrew or Greek, to the great Discouragement of Learning, and Increase of Impiety.—From a thorough Conviction of such horrid Practices we shall, in due Time, commission Thirty of our most able Ecclesiasticks to read and examine all Manuscripts, and licence such only to be printed, which they shall judge for the Honour of God, or our own Benefit.

AS no true Son of the Church can with Patience hear of the Havock and Devastation the House of TUDOR made of her Lands and Revenues, nor of the many Robberies and Impieties committed in those barbarous Times against the Holy See, and the cloistered Saints whom God had so plentifully scattered over the Land, our Pious Intention is, so soon as Affairs will permit, to reinstate our Holy

Mother Church into those Lands and Revenues granted her by the Charity of good Christians. — By the Account furnished us by our Holy Father, it is with the greatest Joy we find, that we shall be enabled to present to the Labourers in the Vineyard of God, a comfortable and reasonable Subsistance, tho' it but a little exceeds Two Thirds of the Lands of the Kingdom.
IN fine, Let us conjure you by the Duty you owe God's Hereditary Vicegerent: By the Love of Peace and Tranquillity, and by the Honour of our supreme and infallible Judge, to hear and consider these our real and sincere Purposes, stripped of any the least Disguise.—Consider our Situation. — Regard our Sword!— Consider, That the Most Christian King is our Support; the Most Catholick our Helper; and those in the Mountains Assertors of our Right.—Let therefore no unsanctify'd Bishop preach you from your Duty, but remember the Happiness, the mighty Happiness we intend to bestow upon you, and be assured on the Faith of a Family who never forfeited their Word.— On the Faith of a Family, whose Virtues and Heroick Deeds are so fully recorded in your Histories, that we

shall not only strictly perform the several Articles in this our gracious Declaration, but shall take all Occasions, and watch all Opportunities of leading you more and more to a State of Perfection here on Earth, and to a State of everlasting Bliss in the World to come. Given at —

Now, by the Foot, the flying Foot were slain;
Horse, trod by Horse, lay foaming on the Plain.
From the dry Fields, thick Clouds of Dust arise,
Shade the black Host, and intercept the Skies;
The brass-hoof'd Steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,
And the thick Thunder beats the lab'ring Ground.

POPE'S Homer.




DOMESTICK Peace was once more established, and the late confused and distracted Kingdom now more sensibly felt the Joys of publick Tranquillity.
THE War with France still raged in Flanders, and required the Presence of those Troops, which a Rebellion had compelled

to withdraw from their Allies, and the necessary Orders were dispatched for embarking sundry Corps. Mr. Conyers was presented to a Troop of Dragoons under these Orders. He now equipt himself in a much better Manner, and was so employed, that he had not Time to visit his Friends; but contented himself with tender Letters to Mr. Sampson, Colonel Manly, and Doctor Grace.—When the Regiments were compleated, the final Orders were given, and Captain Conyers attended his Duty.
HE certainly observed a profound Silence on the Military Operations, for I only found some Orderly Books, written in his own Hand, which, undoubtedly, every Officer ought to do.
FOR the Marches and Encampments of the Army, I must refer to the Gazettes of the Time.—As I ever consult the Ease of my Reader, he will not condemn my Silence, when he considers I have no Lights to guide either Him or myself into Affairs so much above our Knowledge.—However I must follow the Glimmerings I have, and pursue him through his Variety of Marches and foraging Parties, till I find him encamped near Maestricht. I must attend him in crossing the Maese with the Army,

and encamping in the Vicinity of the French, but, even to the Night before the last Battle, I have nothing particular to mention.—This Night, indeed, an Affair happened, which makes so material a Part of this History, that compels a Recital, tho' with my usual Brevity.
THE Captain had been ordered, with Detachments from other Regiments, on a Command to Venlo, for Forage. Disputes frequently happen on these Occasions, which the Commanding Officer must be extremely careful to prevent.—By an Officer's insisting to be served out of his Tour, a Quarrel began: The Clamour was great; but the Captain running to the Spot, exerted his Authority, and directed the Forage in the proper Channel. The Officer whose Name was Thornton, and a Lieutenant of Dragoons, was much out of Humour, and dropt some Words, as much as to say—Captain Conyers would not be always at the Head of a Command!
THE Foraging being over, they returned to Maestricht, where the Captain found an Order, from the Adjutant-General, to join the Army as speedily as possible, after the Men and Horses were refreshed. He communicated this Order to the Officers of the Party, and directed them to join at

the Port, precisely at Two o'Clock in the Morning. These Orders were given to the Men, and he invited the Officers to sup with him at the Helmet, and Lieutenant Thornton was of the Party. This Gentleman was younger than Captain Conyers, but in his Size, and many other Respects, extremely resembled him. He had a very good Character in the Army, but was too apt to imagine an Affront where none was intended. As he was well liked for many good Qualities, this Fault was imputed to his Youth, and Want of Experience.
LIEUTENANT Thomas was likewise of the Company. He was an elderly, rough Sort of a Man, who, from a low Station, had, by Accident, arrived to this Rank. He was educated, and took his Degrees, in a Stable, and, forgetful of the Title he was honoured with by his Majesty's Commission, swore and talked as if still a Dragoon.—This Gentleman began the Affair of the Forage, and seemed to think that Lieutenant Thornton had been injured.— By the L—d, said he, if any Man had served me so, I'd have shewn him the Difference.—Sir, reply'd Mr. Thornton, I know as well as any Man, when I am ill used, and shall take a proper Time to explain myself.'— 'Sir, said the Captain,

who began to be warm, I don't know the Meaning of all this; but should you imagine any ill Treatment, I beg you will shew the Manner, and you shall find me vastly ready to give you every Satisfaction in my Power.— 'Spoke, cry'd Thomas, like a Gentleman, and a Man of Honour.' — Sir, said Thornton, since I must speak, I must tell you, I am a Gentleman of Family and Fortune, perhaps, superior to your self! You insulted me at Venlo; you stopt my Men in their Duty, in a rude and uncivil Manner. This, Sir, may injure my Character and Honour, and calls for immediate Satisfaction.' — 'That's right, said Thomas, the present Time is always the best, therefore, my Advice is, to take a cool Turn on the Parade, and decide the Matter like Friends and Men of Honour.—Thornton rose up, as did Captain Conyers.
—The rest of the Company interposed, and contrary to all Mr. Thomas's Arguments, obliged them to sit down in Peace.
THE young Lieutenant was on fire, and the Captain almost as hot; but a little Reflection brought him to his Reason.—Gentlemen, said the Captain, I am sorry for this Affair, and believe I can convince Mr.

Thornton of a mistaken Point of Honour.— By the L—d, said Thomas, your only best Way, is, by the Point of the Sword. —Sir! said the Captain, with a strong Emphasis, Did I affront you, too?—No, Sir, said Thomas, not me.'— 'Then, Sir, reply'd the other, let me advise you, as you regard your Commission, or your Safety, no more to interfere in our Disputes.— Thomas bit his Lips, but, prudently held his Tongue.—Conyers turned to Mr. Thornton, and said,— You have desired Satisfaction, Sir, and it is my Duty to give it, but permit me first to say, I think you began at the wrong End. What Satisfaction could my Life have afforded you, or your Death have given me, your Family or Friends? — I hope we have had Time to reflect on the Consequences of too precipitate a Resolution.' — 'Sir, reply'd Thornton, the Honour of an Officer is a tender Point.' — 'I confess it, said the Captain, and therefore ought to be tenderly used.—No Satisfaction, Sir, can equal a Conviction of being in an Error. —Here, Sir, are the Orders I received, and submit to the Gentlemen present, if I exceeded them, or shewed the least Partiality.—The Company agreed, that he could not avoid acting as he did; and

he proceeded: — As to your Family and Fortune, they are in this Case, quite out of the Question. I own, Sir, I was in an Hurry to prevent a Dispute; but if any Expressions of Rudeness or Incivility escaped from me, I am sorry for it, and before these Gentlemen, most heartily ask your Pardon. This, Sir, I hope, is the rational and just Satisfaction one Gentleman ought to ask of another; if more is required, I must comply, tho' with Reluctance.

ALL the Company, except Lieutenant Thomas, who was asleep, cryed out, — No Gentleman can desire more, and greatly praised Captain Conyers. — Mr. Thornton confessed his Error, excused himself for his Rashness, and begged that no more might be said about it.—The Captain, affectionately embracing him, wish'd for an Opportunity of shewing his Regard and Friendship.—What Pity it is, said he, that trivial and insignificant Words should raise our Anger, to the Destruction of our Peace and Happiness, and that Incendiaries are not more severely punished.— Had not this good Company been more prudent than Two of us, and honester than a Third, One might, by this Time, have slept with his Fathers, and perhaps

both. — But, come, Gentlemen, let us prepare for Duty where real Honour calls. Let us fight with the common Enemy, but never amongst ourselves. — One Bottle more and then.' — 'And then, said Mr. Thornton, have at the French.
— They finished two Bottles with great Harmony, and often drank Success to the DUKE, and precisely at the Time appointed, marched out of Maestricht, and soon arrived at the Camp.
THIS proved a very busy Day, and made the small Village of LAWFELD Famous.— Those who desire an Account of the Battle, must not apply to me, for my whole Attention is taken up with Capt. Conyers. — When our Dragoons were ordered to Charge, the Captain did singular Service. He rescued his Major, and a Lieutenant-Colonel of another Regiment.—He stopped several Parties who were driving to their Ruin, and directed them where to turn their Swords. — His Head and his Hands were at Work, and in short, as the French Memoir Writers phrase it, He performed Prodigies of Valour.—In the Midst of this, he saw Lieutenant Thornton, with the greatest Bravery, waging unequal War, for he was surrounded by three Cavaliers. —In an Instant, he flew to his Relief, and

effectually took Care of one. By this Time Mr. Thornton was wounded in many Places, and on the Ground; the Captain received a violent Blow on his Head, and two Wounds on his left Shoulder. His Horse was shot, but he manfully defended the Body of his Friend on Foot. Finding the Foe encreased, he desired Quarters, and resigned his Sword to an Officer who had just come up.—At first he imagined Mr. Thornton was killed; but observing some Signs of Life, he persuaded some of the French to carry him to a Place of Safety, and was conducted along with him by the Officer, who was a Gentleman of great Humanity. All possible Care was taken of both; and, the Action over, they were sent to Tongres with other Prisoners.
THE Gentleman to whom he had surrendered, was the Marquis de Brissac, Colonel of a Regiment of Dragoons. His Politeness and good Manners, corresponded with his Quality. He daily visited the Captain, and procured him and Mr. Thornton every Necessary.—The Lieutenant had been severely treated, having no less than seven Wounds in the Head, Shoulders, and Body. Two of them were dangerous, but his Youth and good Constitution surmounted the Difficulty. In three Weeks the Surgeons

declared him in a fair Way of Recovery; but it would require great Time.
THE Marquis was extremely pleased, and expressed himself very genteely on the Occasion. He assured him, that assisting two such valiant Gentlemen was the highest Proof of his good Fortune.— Tho' I was not, said he, a Witness of your Bravery, I am sure it must have been great, but the Courage of the Captain in defending you, is what I shall ever esteem and admire him for. To his Valour you really owe your Life, more than to my Endeavours to save it.

AS our two Prisoners recovered their Strength, the Marquis introduced them to the Duke d'Ayen, with other Officers of Family and Distinction, and every Politeness and Respect was paid them.— They had now their own Servants and Necessaries, and a Credit for Money. In two Months Capt. Conyers was in good Health, but his Left Arm was useless. He got Permission, on his Parole, to go to his Regiment, but promised his Friend to return soon, and, if possible, go with him to Aix-la-Chapelle, which was necessary for both.
CAPTAIN Conyers was received with the greatest Joy by his Corps, and highly honoured by his Superiors. He spoke of

Mr. Thornton in so noble a Manner, that the DUKE gave him a Troop of Dragoons, and Permission to both, to go to Aix, or where they thought proper, to establish their Healths. Capt. Thornton was extremely sensible of the Bounty and Goodness of his Royal Highness, and affectionately embracing Conyers, called him his Father, Brother and Preserver, and vow'd a perpetual Friendship. Capt. Conyers was not behind Hand, and promis'd to attend him, and, if possible, never to part.
AS soon as Capt. Thornton was able to travel, the Friends took their Leave of the Marquis de Brissac, the Duke d'Ayen, and others, in the politest Terms, and testified their Gratitude for all the Civilities received. Capt. Thornton could not think of going to Aix till he had paid his Duty to the Duke, and kissed that Hand which had so nobly rewarded his little Services. He met with a most gracious Reception, and in a few Days left the Camp.
CAPT. Thornton was the Second Son of Sir Roger Thornton, a Gentleman of large Fortune in Ireland and in Essex, and a Member of the House of Commons. He was about Twenty-four Years of Age, spoke French and Italian perfectly well, and understood Drawing, and those Branches

of the Mathematicks, so necessary to every Officer who chooses to distinguish himself. Sir Roger allowed him Three Hundred Pounds a Year, but on this Occasion he very liberally supplied him. He wrote Capt. Conyers a most obliging Letter, for his Son had informed him of the Obligations he lay under. The young Captain received many Letters from his Uncle the Earl of Mountworth, in which Mr. Conyers was always honourably mentioned.
CAPT. Thornton recovered very slowly, and Capt. Conyers's Arm proved much worse than was at first imagined. They stayed a long Time at Aix-la-Chapelle and Spa, and were determined to go to England; but the Peace being just signed, they changed their Resolution, and set out for France.




CHAP. XV.


Of all the Virtues, Justice is the best;
Valour, without it, is a common Pest:
Pyrates and Thieves, too oft with Courage grac'd,
Shew us how ill that Virtue may be plac'd:
'Tis our Complexion makes us chaste or brave;

Justice from Reason, and from Heav'n we have:
All other Virtues dwell but in the Blood;
That in the Soul, and gives the Name of Good.

WALLER.



ON their Arrival at Paris, they hired very grand Apartments in the best Hotel. In a few Days they were prepared to visit the Marquis de Brissac and the Duke d'Ayen, who received them with Marks of the greatest Respect and Esteem. They were visited in Return, and soon made acquainted with the Families of the First Distinction. The Marquis recommended the ablest Surgeon, and they went on very successfully under his Care.
THEY had been about a Month at Paris, when one Day Capt. Conyers took it into

his Head to dress himself as formerly, and dine at the old Ordinary. The People of the House immediately recollected him, and were much rejoiced at his Return— It seems Paris had greatly miss'd the English Guineas that so plentifully roll'd about before the War, and now promised themselves that my Lord Anglais would soon pay the Expence of all their Fireworks and Illuminations.—He found none of his former Acquaintances at Table; but after Dinner he begg'd the good Woman would accept of a Pot of Coffee, and enquired after them.

MONSIEUR Maquereau, said she, had very bad Fortune at Play, and was so reduced, that for some Time he lived on the Women of the Town; but at last he got Religion into his Head, and went into La Trappe.—The Chevalier Fanfaron was very unlucky, for about a Year ago he died of his Wounds.'—I suppose, said Conyers, the Chevalier had an Affair of Honour, and fell by it.' — 'All I know, said the Landlady, is, the Chevalier killed a Gentleman one Night on Pont-Neuf, and was so unfortunate as to be taken and broke Alive on the Wheel, at the Greve.'—'So much for the Chevalier, said the Captain, but you don't tell me

a Word of my good Friend Monsieur Pensé. I hope no Accident has happened to him.'— 'Ah, poor Gentleman! said she, indeed, he is greatly to be pity'd. 'Tis now just two Years since the Archers got into his Lodgings, took him out of Bed, seized all his Papers and Effects, and carry'd them to the Bastile. God knows if he be dead or alive. Somebody said he was a Spy for the English, and so the poor good Man was ruined.

THE Captain enquired for no more, but finished the Coffee, thank'd the good Woman, and went in a Hurry to his Lodgings. He was vastly moved at the Fate of Pensé, and determin'd to try his Interest to save him, if it was not too late.—He soon dress'd, and follow'd Captain Thornton to the Marquis's, where he had dined. The Company were informed of the Morning dishabillé and imputed it, and his long Stay, to some Affair of Gallantry, on which he was heartily railly'd. He railly'd in his Turn, and the Conversation fell into the usual Channel. The Duke d'Ayen came in soon after, and in a little Time the whole Company went to the Opera.

CAPTAIN Conyers took Care to place himself next to the Duke, and at last found an Opportunity of mentioning the Case of

Pensé. He concluded with assuring his Lordship, that he held the Office of a Spy in the utmost Contempt: But, said he, this unhappy Man has formerly render'd me more Services than I can ever repay; therefore I hope your Lordship will consider the Gratitude I owe, and grant a Favour to me, and not to him.'—'I protest, said the Duke, I never heard of this Man, but all in my Power you may command. I shall speak to my Father, (Marshal Noailles) and interest myself to the utmost. Should I succeed, you shall soon hear of it, but my Silence will convince you of the Impossibility.

CONYERS pass'd four Days in great Anxiety, but the fifth he had a Visit from the Duke, who, after some Conversation, told him, his Friend was alive.— Then, my Lord, said the Captain, so am I. This is a great Point gain'd; but I hope more remains.'— 'Yes, reply'd the Duke, I will not keep you longer in Suspence. The Marshal with some Difficulty, undertook the Cause, and I have brought you an Order to the Governor, to deliver Mr. Pensé and all his Effects, into your Hands, but with this Injunction, that he quits Paris in twenty-four Hours, and France in a Week.—The Captain took

the Order, and most heartily thank'd the Duke.— I know not, said this Nobleman, how Pensé escaped, for he has been a most notorious Offender; but his Art was great, and by little Discoveries protracted his Time so long, that I believe, at last, they were ashamed to hang him. —But I see you are impatient to be the Messenger of good News, and shall only add, that I expect you To-morrow at Dinner.—He was in the highest Delight, and immediately drove to the Bastile, accompanied by Capt. Thornton.

THE proper Compliments being paid to the Governor, the Captain mentioned Mr. Pensé, but was answer'd civilly, tho' in a cold unsatisfactory Manner.— Sir, said the Captain, I believe I have a Paper in my Hand, that will convince you I am not here to ask impertinent Questions.— When the Governor had read and carefully examin'd the Order, he behaved quite in another Manner, and directed a Servant to call Mr. Pensé to him.—He spoke much of the poor Man, but seem'd to hint, that all Things consider'd, he had surprising good Fortune.—Pensé was conducted into the Chamber, but his Countenance was so changed, that his Friend scarcely knew him.—He bow'd and trembled. — A small

Silence intervened, but, fixing his Eyes intently on Captain Conyers, and, at last, crediting their Evidence, he cry'd out.—It is he, and flew to his Arms. He hung on his Neck. He had not Words to testify his Amazement. He clasp'd him, and was in an Agony of Joy, till Tears moderated the Excess. He sobb'd, and ask'd broken Questions, every Moment embracing his Friend.—The Scene was very moving, nor could the Captain refrain the manly honest Tribute of a Tear.
THE Governor told Mr. Pensé, that he was at Liberty to go with the Gentlemen. That his Papers were sealed up, as was the Value of his Effects in a Box, which he might take with him; but gave him the Orders about quitting the Kingdom. — Mr. Pensé made many Compliments, but seem'd to wish he was out of the Walls, which Half an Hour saw done; and the Captain conducted him to his Lodgings.
AS his Time was to be short in Paris, they abridg'd a thousand Questions to each other, and reserved them for a more favourable Opportunity, only the Captain mention'd the Situation he was in, as to Rank and Fortune, which gave the old Man a most sensible Pleasure. — They now examin'd his Finances, and found he had a

Remainder of six hundred Pounds Sterling. They debated on the Application of the Money, but found, that the mere Interest would by no Means afford him a decent Maintenance. — My dear Friend, said Pensé, let me settle this Affair.— Take the Money, and allow me what you think proper, by way of Pension, during my Life.—Be it so, reply'd the Captain, and immediately he drew up a little Instrument, and gave him a Letter to his Banker in London, to honour his Bills for twenty-five Pounds for every three Months.—Poor Pensé once more shed Tears, and could only add —You are too good, and I am too happy.

MANY Towns were proposed for his Residence, for to England he could not safely go, and the Captain fixed on Brussels as a cheap and agreeable Place. Matters being thus adjusted, they pass'd the Remainder of the Day to their mutual Satisfaction; and next Morning Pensé bid Adieu to his faithful Friend, and took the Coach to Lisle, but not before the Captain had obliged him to accept of Forty Pieces.

PERHAPS I ought to extol the Goodnature of Capt. Conyers: — To paint his Friendship in the brightest Colours, and to shew the Amiableness and Self-Satisfaction

of a grateful Heart.—By so doing, should I not deprive my Reader of the Pleasure of doing it himself? — When I consult my own Ease, 'tis only with a View of indulging his Judgment.


CHAP. XVI.


— His curdling Blood forgot to glide;
Confusion on his fainting Vitals hung,
And fault'ring Accents flutter'd on his Tongue.

GARTH.



CAPT. Thornton was not yet quite cured; for his Wounds, by some little Irregularities, had frequently opened. Capt. Conyers was perfectly recover'd; and as his Regiment had been for some Time in England, he began to consider that his Duty required his Presence. Whilst he was preparing to attend it, he received a Letter that gave him Pain and Pleasure. In short, the Regiment was broke. He was now his own Master, and determin'd to stay with his Friend till he was quite fit to Travel.


SINCE, said he, that I am now at full Liberty, and have an easy Fortune, ought I not to think on those Friends to whom I owe my very Being? Perhaps that dear good Man Mr. Kindly, or some of his Family may want my Assistance.— Perhaps I may be useful to the worthy Lord Truegood, or his charming Sons. Heavens! what a Joy must I not feel at contributing to their Satisfaction! What Pleasure will they not receive at seeing their little Jack completely happy! — Ought I not to think on my Mother? Ought I not to seek her out, and relieve her Distresses? and have I not neglected these Duties too long?—Such Thoughts made him glow with alternate Shame and Pleasure, and determin'd him to visit Ireland as soon as possible.
THE Captains pass'd their Time in Paris in the most agreeable Manner, and were much respected by the Ladies. I find a few Hints that persuade me, they were not without Amusements of a delicate Nature; but as the Papers are silent as to the Particulars, so must I.
IT happen'd that Capt. Magragh of Lord Clare's Regiment, had lately taken Apartments in the same Hotel. This Gentleman thought it his Duty to pay his Respects to

the two English Officers, and made them a very civil Visit. They received him in a polite Manner, and in an Hour's Conversation found out his Rank and his Character. He was of a lively Soldier-like Disposition, and very communicative. His Father had quitted Ireland, and follow'd the Fortune of King James the Second. He was born in France, but spoke English with a prodigious Irish Accent, tho' he had never been in that Kingdom. He told them of the vast Estate his Father lost in Ireland, and how near he was, the other Day, of recovering it. He spoke of the War in Germany and in Flanders, and gave them a History of his own Exploits. He mentioned the Valour of the Irish, and without considering the French Policy, seem'd to glory in their being sent foremost on the most desperate Attacks. His Conversation, and the Oddity of his Language, was agreeable enough, and made our Friends desire a further Acquaintance.
IN a few Days he invited them to a genteel Supper, with two other Officers of the Irish Brigade. The Chat turn'd on War, and Capt. Magragh spoke very eloquently on Sieges and Battles, for he could really speak on little else.—One of the Officers, in a laughing Way, mention'd something of

an unfortunate Expedition into Spain, which obliged the Captain to enlarge upon it. Gentlemen, said he, I must tell you my fatal Story. You must know, that my Father's Brother, that is, my Uncle by the Father's Side, was a Merchant at Cadiz. He was as rich as a thousand Jews, and always promised to make me his Son and Heir, but — the Devil fire all Priests! About seventeen or eighteen Years ago, a Son of a Whore, one Father Kelly, came over from Ireland, and brought his Sister with him. She was the Widow of one Squire Connor, and young and handsome enough. What will you have of it, but my foolish Uncle got acquainted with this Father Kelly and his Sister, and by my own Sowle he married her. To be sure I wrote to my Uncle, and towld him what a Fool he was, and what a Rogue he was to cheat a Gentleman like me, and his own Flesh and Blood. The old Fellow was very saucy, and by my own Sowle I had a great Mind to go to Spain and beat his Coat. Well, Gentlemen, about two Years agon I got a Letter from a Friend at Cadiz, that my Uncle was growing sickly; so I took Post, thinking to make it up with him, but by my Sowle, I was

late, for the old Teef hid himself under Ground. Now, will you believe it? The Devil take me, and I swear by him that made me, if the old Rogue left me a grey Groat. I spoke to Madam my Aunt, and towld her of my Journey, and my great Expences, and of the Wrong she did me, and the like, and only begg'd her to let us fairly divide the Money betwixt us. The Lady began to laugh, but said, she had some Commiseration on me, and made some fine Speeches; but the Devil a Farthing would she give but four hundred Pistoles. I took the Money, and giving her a hearty Curse, wish'd her and her thirty thousand Pound at Hell.'—'You had hard Fortune, indeed, said Capt. Thornton; but perhaps she may make you Amends some Time or other.' Sir, reply'd Magragh, I shall never trouble her no more. I am now a Captain in the first best Regiment in Europe; I have the Cross of St. Lewis, which the King gave me, because I wouldn't be kill'd at Philipsbourg, and I have a Royal Donation of three hundred Livres a Year; so, my Dear, what do I want? I love my Friends, and my good Friends love me; and I vow to God, I am as happy as the King himself, God bless him. I

love my Countrymen the Irish, and I love the English well enough, but Faith and Sowle, they are too hard upon us.

CAPTAIN Thornton observ'd a peculiar Gravity in the Countenance of his Friend, and thought, by changing the Current of Conversation, to remove it. He try'd many Ways, but Conyers seem'd lost in Thought. His Silence gave a serious Turn to the Company, and they broke up much sooner than was intended.
NEXT Morning Captain Thornton had a very early Visit from Mr. Conyers, for he had not slept. — My dear Thornton, said he, you must wonder at my Behaviour, but I insist on your Friendship, and beg you will not require an Explanation of the only Thing I cannot divulge.— Thornton imagin'd a Quarrel, and rose in a Hurry to stop his going out of the Room. His Friend could not forbear laughing at his serious Figure, but assuring him on his Honour, that a Quarrel was the least in his Thoughts, the other was pacify'd and returned to his Bed.—I am, said Conyers, in the oddest Situation, perhaps, ever Man was in. I am far from unhappy; but some Doubts and Anxieties so much torment me, that I cannot be at Peace till they are satisfy'd.' 'Dear

Conyers, said the other, I hope you will indulge me with my Share of what gives you Uneasiness; I think I have a just Claim to it.—'I believe, reply'd Conyers, your Friendship is sincere; but my Case is of such a Nature, that as you cannot assist me, I must only desire your Patience.

HE revolv'd a thousand Projects to bring about his Affair in the properest Manner. He remember'd Father Kelly, and call'd back every Circumstance of his Childhood so clearly, that he had not the least Doubt but Mrs. Magragh was his Mother.—He reflected on her Features, and brought her Face familiar to his Imagination. He own'd she had not been the tenderest of Parents, but Nature spoke, and threw her Faults into the most favourable Light. He ardently wish'd to embrace her, and, as his filial Affection arose, the tender Tear fell down his Cheeks. The good, the humane Heart, will not call this an unmanly Weakness. — The Sensations of his Soul were natural, and the result of an honest Mind. At last he determin'd on a Journey to Cadiz, and went immediately to Mr. Waters, his Banker, for proper Letters.

WHILST he was speaking to this Gentleman on the necessary Credit he might want, he took an Opportunity of asking him if he knew Mr. Magragh, who had been a Merchant at Cadiz. 
Yes, Sir, reply'd Mr. Waters, extremely well, for he was my Correspondent many Years.' I hear, said the Captain, he has left a Widow, and should be glad to know if she be alive.' 'She was so, very lately, answer'd the Banker, for I have had Letters from her about some Effects remaining in my Hands. I assure you, she is a very notable Woman, and vastly rich.' As for her Riches, said Conyers, I have nothing to say; but you would much oblige me, by recommending me to her Notice and good Offices, in a friendly Manner; and likewise for another Letter, wherein you will please to mention me as her near Relation. This last I shall only make Use of, in case I find her really so. Mr. Waters very readily comply'd, and promis'd to be very secret in the Affair.
CAPTAIN Conyers was now much easier in his Mind, and the Alteration in his Conduct, gave a very sensible Pleasure to his Friend, but it was of short Duration, for he inform'd him, that he was oblig'd

to set out immediately for Madrid, where his Stay should be as short as possible. Captain Thornton was oblig'd to acquiesce, and Preparations were made for his Journey. The Marquis de Brissac was surpriz'd at the Project of Mr. Conyers, but got him Recommendatory Letters to the French Minister, and advis'd his travelling with the King's Messenger, especially as he seem'd in Haste. — A Messenger was dispatch'd the Week following, who had Orders to take particular Care of the Captain.—He took a Servant with him, and, with some Reluctance, bid adieu to his Friends.



CHAP. XVII.


Now, by my Soul, and by these hoary Hairs,
I'm so o'erwhelm'd with Pleasure, that I feel
A later Spring within my wither'd Limbs,
That shoots me out again.

DRYDEN'S Don. Seb.


AN Account of a Journey, Post, must be very unsatisfactory to a Reader, and tire and fatigue him as much as the Traveller. I shall, therefore, avoid the dry, insipid Relation, and beg of him to suppose, that no Accident happen'd on the Road, and that our Captain got safe to Madrid in the usual Time. I shall omit the Civilities shew'd by the French Minister, who advis'd him, in the best Manner, for his further Journey to Cadiz. He was impatient to be there, and so am I.
ON his Arrival, he waited on Mr. Fitzgerald, the Merchant, on whom he had a Credit. This Gentleman received him in the most courteous Manner, and insisted

on his accepting an Apartment in his House. In a Day or two, Captain Conyers made an Enquiry about Mrs. Magragh, and mention'd a Letter he had for her. The Merchant told him, she was an intimate Friend, and offering to accompany him, they immediately paid her a Visit.— Judge, gentle Reader, the Emotions of his Soul, when Mr. Fitzgerald presented him to his Mother, for such she really was.— Tho' he was determin'd in his Conduct, and had put on every Resolution, yet he trembled and grew pale when he saluted her; but recovering himself, he attributed his Tremor to the Fatigue of his Journey, which was easily credited. Mrs. Magragh read the Letter, and with great Politeness, assur'd him of her Respects, and Readiness to serve him. They din'd that Day at Mr. Fitzgerald's, and the Captain endeavour'd to make himself as agreeable as possible, and few Men could be more so. He observ'd, that every Body paid Mrs. Magragh a particular Respect; that she was vastly improved, and spoke with great Strength of Reason and Sense, tho' in her former Tone of Voice. Time had added a few Wrinkles to her Brow, but had taken away very little of the Beauty of

her Complexion. — He frequently caught himself too earnestly looking at her, and very often met her Eyes.
NEXT Day the Company din'd at her House. Mirth and Good-humour abounded, and each strove who should add most. Mrs. Magragh shew'd a more than common Civility to the Captain, and often repeated, that he had much of the Air of a Gentleman who had been a very dear Friend to her and her Family. In a Word, she became familiar, which still made her more agreeable.
MR. FITZGERALD ask'd, when they got home, What he had done to the Widow? For, said he, she told me in Spanish, that you had such a Face, and such a Voice, she could scarce keep her Eyes off of you. Faith, Captain, continued he, 'twould be very unkind to snap up one of our greatest Fortunes at so short a Warning, when she has held out half a Dozen regular Sieges.
— Mrs. Fitzgerald a little raillied him, But I assure you, said she, without a Jest, I never saw Mrs. Magragh so free, and so pleas'd with a Gentleman in all my Life.—The Captain laugh'd in his Turn, and each had somewhat to say.

HE thought Matters were pretty ripe for an Explanation, and as Mrs. Magragh had given him a general Invitation, he determin'd on a Visit, and, if possible, to open the Scene. Next Morning he went to Breakfast with her, and was very kindly received. When the ordinary Chat was over, and her Maid had retir'd, he began to put his Scheme in Practice, but not without many Hesitations.—Madam, said he, I never thought to be so much beholden to my Friend Mr. Waters, as I find I am, by being introduc'd to a Lady of your Merit, who has certainly afforded me more Joy than ever I expected to receive.' — 'This other Letter, Madam, will a little help me in what I am to say.'—'She took the Letter, and very attentively read it, and her Eyes seem'd to examine him as carefully.'—'This Letter, Sir, said she, informs me, that you are my Relation. I cannot say the contrary, but I protest I am at a Loss how it can be. I own I have a very particular Regard for you on account of my Friend's hearty Recommendation.— I confess my Esteem for your Person and Behaviour, and as you appear a Gentleman, I should be sorry to change

my Conduct, by your going on any erroneous Project.' — 'Give me Leave, Madam, reply'd the Captain, to assure you on my Honour, I have no Views, other than paying the greatest Respect and Duty where I so naturally owe them.' — 'I should think myself, said she, extremely happy to have a Relation of your Character and Figure. Tho' I cannot imagine such a Thing possible, yet I own there is something that makes me wish it, therefore, I beg Sir, you will inform me, and doubt not but it will be to our mutual Satisfaction.


IS it possible, Madam, said he, that twenty Years can have worn out all Remembrance of my Face?—Can you forget our wretched Situation on the Common in Ireland?—Can my poor blind Father—'Stop, Sir, cry'd she, for Heaven's Sake! — I know not what to think! Good God! —Pray, have Patience, and let me recover my Breath.—Her Agony was extreme, and he was oblig'd to support her to the Window for Air. — Gracious Heaven, said she at last, I dare not hope for such a Blessing, but let me beseech you, Sir, to pull down your right Stocking. — He instantly obey'd, and

when she discover'd a large Mole on his Leg, (which he had never observ'd) Yes! cry'd she, 'It is my dearest, my ill-us'd Son.' —Oh, Jack! — and clasping him in her Arms in Transport, was, for some Moments depriv'd of every Sense. He embrac'd her with the sincerest Affection, and, for a long While, neither could utter a Syllable.
ONCE more I must indulge the Imagination of the kind Reader, and permit him to supply, from his own natural Stock, what mine is defective in.—Let him call forth every tender Idea. Let him think on the Affection of a Parent; on the Love of a Child, and, if he can, let him conceive the mighty Joy at recovering our long lost darling Hopes. Let him do this, and it is possible he may have some faint Idea of what this poor Woman felt. But to paint convulsive Motions, to mark the alternate Complexion, and to set down every dropping passionate Word, is not in the Power of Mr. Le Sage, Crebillon, Fielding, or even a Ch—t—f—d.—When the good-natur'd Reader has finish'd his private Reflections, I beg he will go one Step farther, and bring back the Mother and Son to their wonted Sense and Understanding.


MY dearest Jack, said she, I have treated you barbarously.—Indeed I have,— but I shall try to atone for all my Sins. God has been bountiful to you, and most merciful to me! — I have not merited his Goodness, but shall endeavour to deserve his Favour.—I hope I shall.—But, my dear Jack, give me some Account of yourself. Tell me of all your Accidents; how you arriv'd to the honourable Station I see you in, and why your Name is Conyers.—Tell me all, my dear Child, and I shall most faithfully recount, tho' I blush for it, every Part of my Life since we parted.— Oh, my Son! Could you have known the Trouble, my Usage to you has given me, you would pity an unhappy Woman.—But, tell me, my dear Jack, can you forgive me?—I fear it is impossible.'—'My Conduct, said he, shall convince my dearest Mother, that I have forgot all Things, but my Duty and my Love.'—Then, said she, I am happy, and my Love shall reward you.—But no more now. — You must change your Quarters, and live with me.—Does Mr. Waters know you are my Son?'—'No, Madam, said the Captain, he knows no more than what I desir'd him to mention

in his Letter.' — 'That's well, said she, neither is it necessary he should. I must not own you for my Son, as it would contradict what I have always reported, but you must be my Nephew, the Son of my Sister, which will sufficiently warrant my Affection for you.

THIS Matter being settled, they went together to Mr. Fitzgerald's. The Family were greatly surpris'd and pleas'd when Mrs. Magragh presented her Nephew. She told them the Method he took to discover himself, and all Compliments were made suitable to the Occasion. That Night he return'd to her House, and the whole Town visited and congratulated them.



CHAP. XVIII.


An unseen Hand makes all our Moves:
And some are Great, and some are Small;

Some climb to Good, some from good Fortune fall;
Some wise Men, and some Fools we call;
Figures, alas! of Speech, for Destiny plays us all.

COWLEY.



NO doubt Mrs. Magragh was impatient to hear the Story of her Son, and begg'd he would begin, and not omit the minutest Circumstances. He obey'd, and carried her through every Scene of his Life, except a few Parts not so fit for her to hear, and concluded, by his being a Captain of Dragoons; the Accident that brought him to the Knowledge of her being alive, and how soon he determin'd to pay his Duty.—He did not mention his being on Half-Pay, lest she should have insisted on his staying at Cadiz, which he by no Means intended to do.—He recited all his Adventures in a full and clear Manner, and so pathetically worded his Sufferings,

that she wept most bitterly, but, his good Fortune succeeding, a visible Joy spread over her Countenance. — She embraced him a thousand Times, and blest God for restoring to her a Son, and a Son of such Prudence and so many Virtues.

Now, said she, my dear Jack, it is but just to recount my own History, and inform you of some Things that you are a Stranger to.
SHE then began from her being a Servant at Sir Roger Thornton's. — In this Family, said she, I lived very happily. I was young, and tolerably handsome, and it pleased Sir Roger to think me more so than perhaps I really was. He made me Presents, seem'd very fond of me, was a mighty fine comely Gentleman; and, in short, overcome my foolish Weakness. I proved with Child, and he married me to Jerry Connor. You came into the World with that Name, but my dear Jack, your real Father was Sir Roger Thornton.'— 'More Wonders! cry'd her Son, — Is it possible! — She seem'd surprised at his Exclamations, but he inform'd her of his Intimacy with Captain Thornton, and of the Accident that brought on their great Friendship. She was vastly delighted with this Incident,

and charm'd to find Sir Roger was still alive.

THIS obliged her to begin a little more particularly, and she continued her Account to the Death of Jerry Connor, and the Parting with her Son.—As I have placed all these Facts in the first Pages of this History, where I imagin'd they naturally came in, I must refer my Reader to them, and take up her Story where I dropt it.

THUS, said she, Father Kelly and I cohabited in a scandalous Manner; and the Proofs against us were so strong and so many, that he could not live in the Country. His Uncle the Bishop gave him a good Sum of Money, and a Letter to a Prior of a rich Convent in this City. He persuaded me to go with him, (and I had no Business to stay behind) but he would by no Means consent to my taking you. I was in the utmost Trouble, and could not think of parting with my Child for ever. At last he proposed sending you to his Brother's in the County of Galway, who would take care of your Education, and, at a certain Age, send you to Cadiz.—The barbarous Wretch laid the Scheme, and exposed you to perish on the Road. He was so

cruel, that he never would give me the least Satisfaction, or let me know what he had done with you. I was too much depending on him to quarrel, and had no other Consolation but my frequent Tears.
WE embark'd at Cork in a Ship loaded with Beef, Tallow, and Worsted Stuffs, and arrived safe at this Place. It was agreed I should pass for his Sister, and the Widow of one Mr. Connor of Clonmell. He went to the Convent, and deliver'd his Letter to Father Purcell the Prior, where I believe he was well received, for he return'd vastly pleased. He was soon in the Habit of his Order, and provided me a Lodging in a good Family, and made me dress in a very decent Manner.
I KNOW not how he managed with the Prior, but he gave me to understand, that I must call him my Uncle, and be extremely civil when he visited me, and next Day I had that Honour. Father Purcell, or rather my Uncle, was a comely, grave Man, of about Sixty, vastly polite, and courteous, and, seemingly, of a most religious Deportment. However, my pious Brother soon hinted, that I was to be more than merely civil to him, if I expected

to be maintain'd.—What could I do?—I was compelled to forfeit my Honour, that I might save my Reputation. In short, I comply'd, and my Brother and Uncle constantly visited me, and were mighty tender and affectionate Relations.

YOU see, my dearest Jack, I hide not from you, even my own Shame.—How are the best Institutions perverted! but let us not condemn the Whole for the Wickedness of a Few.—Thus I lived for about four or five Months, and was visited by the best Families, and paid them in Return. I own I was not a fit Companion for People of Fortune; but as I could not converse in their Manner, I behaved with great Modesty and Silence. This procured me a general good Character, and made me pass for what I did not merit.
I HAD a Mind to try the Temper of Father Purcell, and one Day very gravely hinted an Apprehension of my being with Child. The old Man stared, and was in a strange Dilemma, for he had no Notion but Father Kelly was my real Brother.—He walk'd about the Room in a very pensive Manner, but at last — Well, said he, if my dear Widow be with Child, I must find a Father for it.

—Shall I get you a Husband? — 'I have no Objection, said I, provided he be a good one.'—"Leave it to me, reply'd the Prior; but it must be done in a Hurry, and shall instantly set about it; so put on your best Airs for a Visit To-morrow Evening." — 'I took his Advice, but could not forbear laughing at the Oddity of my Scheme, and wonder'd where it would end.
FATHER PURCELL kept his Word, and introduced Mr. Magragh. He seem'd a plain good Sort of a Man, of about Fifty-five. He was very ceremonious and complaisant, but spoke little. In Half an Hour the Prior open'd a more interesting Conversation.— "My dear Niece, said he, my good Friend Mr. Magragh has often seen you, and has communicated his Sentiments to me. No Doubt you are of Age to chuse for yourself; but as I know his Integrity and Worth, I think it my Duty, as a Parent, to advise you to receive his honourable Addresses as you ought. — It will be much better than returning to Ireland." — 'I blush'd, and only reply'd, That I should always be guided by him.

"MADAM, said Mr. Magragh, I am a Man in Trade, of a good Character, and an easy Fortune. His Reverence has told you my Heart, which, if you will be pleased to accept, you shall command every Thing in my Power." Sir, said I, I doubt not your Merit, and as my Uncle is your Friend, I am sure he means an Happiness to us both, and shall submit myself to his Determination.— This, said the Prior, is making Love like People of Sense, and not like giddy Children. Come, my dear Niece, since you leave it to me, give me your Hand. —Here, my good Friend, I bestow you that inestimable Treasure, a good Wife.—Take her, and I pray God to bless you both."—Mr. Magragh embraced me very tenderly, and I behaved as I ought.
"WELL, Madam, said the poor Man, when shall I be happy?—When shall I call you my own?—Lord, Sir, said I, you are so pressing.—I believe a Month or two will be Time enough.—"A Month, cry'd the Prior; nay, now you spoil all. I hop'd you would have mention'd To-morrow."—"And I, said Mr. Magragh, was thinking on the present Minute; for my Maxim is, Never

to put off till To-morrow, what I can do To-day,"—"'Tis a most excellent Rule, reply'd the Prior, and let us put it in Practice. What say you, my dear Neice?—Shall I perform the Holy Office?"—I blush'd, but made no Answer.—"Silence, said he, is a Consent, therefore let us go to Mr. Magragh's, send for a few Friends, and finish the Business."—"His Reverence, said my Lover, has been always my Friend."— With some Intreaties, I suffer'd myself to be conducted to his House, where, in the Presence of my Brother and two more, my good Uncle perform'd his Priestly Duty, and made me Mistress of this Habitation.
MR. MAGRAGH was really a good-natur'd inoffensive Man, and very affectionately lov'd me. I kept very good Company, I read a good deal, and wrote, and assisted him very much in his Business. By Degrees I grew very expert, and began to think and talk in a quite different Manner.—My poor Husband was extremely delighted with my Diligence and Capacity, and only wanted a Child to compleat his Happiness; but none came, notwithstanding the frequent

and fervent Prayers of the holy Prior and my pious Brother.

THUS I liv'd for about five Years, with great seeming Happiness; but your Image, and Father Kelly's Person, were too often present to make me really so. I dreaded his more than Brotherly Love; for he sometimes visited at very improper Seasons. I knew his Temper, and, as he began to be suspected on many Accounts, particularly for some Intrigues with Spanish Ladies, I was in continual Apprehensions of some fatal Accident. Nay, I much fear'd the Jealousy of the Prior, for he gave me some Hints. At last I miss'd the Visits of my Brother, and enquir'd after him from my Uncle. He shook his Head, but no satisfactory Answer came. I cry'd for my Brother, but I never saw him since.— He was either murder'd, or carry'd to the Inquisition, and I violently suspected the Prior. —I was really sorry for his Misfortune, but not displeas'd at the Loss of his Company. I was much more satisfy'd, when, in three Months after, my holy Uncle, Father Purcell, departed this Life, and left me to enjoy it with Peace and real Happiness.


THESE Impediments to the Tranquility of my Mind being remov'd, I apply'd myself more closely to the Study of every Thing that might give my Husband Pleasure. I still improved, and arrived to such Perfection, that he confided all to my Care and Management; and I aver to you, my dearest Jack, that I never deceived him in any Shape, after the Death of the Prior.

HIS Fortune increas'd very largely, and we liv'd with great Harmony and Content. The last two Years, his Infirmities made him extremely peevish; but I bore all with Patience, and assisted and attended him with the Tenderness and Duty of a good Wife. The Poor Man was sensible of my Regard, and, when he died, I found his Will had made me absolute Mistress of his whole Fortune.
I HAVE resisted many Sollicitations from People who call'd themselves Lovers. I knew the World too well, to imagine a Woman of my Years had all the Charms they pretended to find in me. I fancy I guess'd right, that my thirty thousand Pounds was my principal Beauty.—Now, my dear Jack, forget the Injury I did you, and forget my

Faults, which I have most sincerely repented of, and you shall be my Husband, nor will I ever have another.—Tho' we are, unhappily, of different Religions, yet, believe me, I am not so bigotted to mine, as to desire a Change in your's. I have learnt by Experience, that the true End and Use of Religion, is to make us good, virtuous, and charitable.—Since your Religion has taught you the Practice of those great Duties, Why should I wish you to alter? No, my dear Jack, keep strictly to, and be faithful in it.—My Religion did not make me wicked; it was my Weakness and my Ignorance. Thank God, I am now wiser. I find, my dear Child, that your Duty will soon call you from me; but to convince you of the Sincerity of my Love, half my Fortune is this Moment your's. When all my Affairs are settled, I will follow you to England, and you shall command the Remainder, allowing me four hundred Pounds a Year during my Life; which will be more than I shall have Occasion for. I hope my dearest Jack is now convinc'd, that I make every Satisfaction in my Power, and that I at last prove myself a tender and affectionate Mother.


THE Captain most ardently embrac'd her, and return'd every Acknowledgement that so much Goodness deserv'd. She set about her Promise immediately, and, in a short Time, gave him Bills on London for fifteen thousand Pounds.

WHILST these Matters were transacting, he received a Letter from his Friend Thornton, declaring his Unhappiness without him, and pressing his Return. He likewise received Letters from Colonel Manly, and Doctor Grace. These gave him great Concern, for they inform'd him of the Death of his old Master, good Mr. Sampson. He had requested his Wife to settle the Fortune on Captain Conyers, at her Death, and she had most generously executed the proper Deeds, reserving two thousand Pounds to dispose of as she thought proper.
HE acquainted his Mother with these Matters, and how necessary his Presence was, to take Care of his Estate, and his Military Post. She confess'd the Reasonableness of his Desires, and promising to part with him, with as little Regret as possible, he prepared to set out, the first Opportunity, by Sea, to Marseilles.

SHE gave him many useful Instructions, and advis'd him to Secrecy with Regard to

his Family, and the Obsurity of his Birth. —Tho', said she, you are in Fact more Praise-worthy, by having made your Fortune with a fair Character, than had it descended from your Father; yet the World is made of such envious Stuff, they take Pleasure in lessening the Virtues of others; yet it is certain he rises the Higher with the sensible Part of the World, the Lower he sprung from.



YOUR Fortune, my dear Son, continued she, will be now very considerable, but let me beg of you to believe, that no Fortune can stand long against bad Management. Be an Oeconomist, and put your Affairs in so regular a Channel, that, in an Instant, you may know your Income and your Expences. Without Regularity, all will be in Confusion. Let your Accounts and your Watch be wound up punctually to a Time, or both will go wrong.—Avoid a Number of idle and superfluous Servants, that eat out an Estate; keep from expensive Schemes and Projects; and trouble, or rather please, the Lawyers as little as possible.—Determine to be happy, for you know the Means.—One Word more, and I have done.—I guess at your Constitution by your Complexion, therefore I advise you

to marry, but submit the Manner to your own Prudence.

HE was often astonish'd how she came to reason, speak and write so correctly, and could not avoid asking her the Question. —It is not, said she, so difficult a Matter as you imagine, though we must have some Assistance from Nature.—I very severely felt the Want of these Accomplishments, and resolv'd, if possible, to acquire them.—I told you I read much. I got good Authors, and apply'd closely to them. They gave me Sentiments I was a Stranger to. I improv'd considerably by the Help of Company, but my own Project vastly shorten'd my Labour. I set myself a Task every Day, and carefully wrote out two or three Pages of the Spectator, Guardian, and other sensible Works, so that in a short Time I became Mistress of their Stile and Manner, had always something to say in Conversation, and spelt well, without the Assisstance of a Grammar. Besides, the Accounts I kept, and the Numbers of Letters I wrote, made these Matters familiar to me.—This may serve to shew you, That a little Pains and Industry in the Beginning, prevents a vast Deal of Trouble and Labour in the End.



IF Captain Conyers was pleas'd at finding his Mother, he was prodigiously more so, at discovering in her all the Marks of good Sense and Prudence.—He remitted his Money to his Correspondent in London, but at the same Time acquainted Colonel Manly of it, and added a Codicil to his Will. He wrote to all his Friends, and promis'd to join them as soon as possible.
A GOOD Ship being now ready to sail, he paid his Respects to all his Acquaintances at Cadiz, and made some genteel Presents, particularly to the Family of Mr. Fitzgerald.—All were concern'd at losing so polite a Companion, and he was loaded with Praises and Caresses. His Mother could not bear it with that Resignation she at first thought; but however, she rais'd her Spirits, and, with many Blessings, saw him set Sail.
THE Voyage was prosperous, and he arrived at Marseilles safe, and in good Health. He took Post for Paris, and once more embrac'd his dear Friend Capt. Thornton, after an Absence of eight Months.



CHAP. XIX.


Thou Brother of my Choice: A Band more sacred
Than Nature's brittle Tie. By holy Friendship,

Glory and Fame stood still for thy Arrival;
My Soul seem'd wanting of its better Half,
And languish'd for thy Absence; like a Prophet
That waits the Inspiration of his God.

ROWE'S Tamerlane.


HE found Paris extremely crouded with English, and began to think, that the Scheme of Doctor Grace, for a Duty on the Exportation of our Nobility and Gentry, would yield a much larger Revenue than could be well imagin'd.—Capt. Thornton was quite recover'd, and had waited a Month extraordinary.—I assure you, said he, I almost despair'd of you, and was just preparing to set out with my Cousin Lord Truegood.'—'Lord Truegood! cry'd Captain Conyers in a Hurry.'—'Yes, reply'd the other, Lord Truegood, my Uncle, the Earl of Mountworth's Son.—

Do you know him?'—'No, answer'd Conyers, but the Similitude of a Name I have a great Respect for, certainly gave me a Flutter.'—'Now I think of it, said Thornton, you could not know him, at least by this Title, for his Father was created an Earl but since the Rebellion.— I promise you, my Cousin is well worth your Acquaintance.—Just then Lord Truegood enter'd.—My Lord, said Thornton, give me Leave to present to you my dearest and most worthy Friend Captain Conyers, and I insist on your loving him as well as I do.'—'It always affords me, said my Lord, the highest Satisfaction to be known to Gentlemen of your distinguish'd Worth and Merit, and wish I may deserve the Honour of your Friendship.'—'If it be an Honour, said Conyers, what must mine be, should your Lordship grant me your favourable Opinion and Countenance?'—'A Truce with your Compliments, cry'd Thornton, let us be a Triumvirate, and make the World stare at our Friendship.

BY Degrees, they dropp'd into the familiar Stile, and each seem'd happy in the other two.—Conyers very attentively examin'd the Features of my Lord, and call'd to his Remembrance his much belov'd

Master Harry.—His Heart felt an unusual Pleasure; Joy sparkled in his Eyes, and added such Charms to his Conversation, that his Friend protested, he believ'd the Gravity of the Spaniards had only served to give him more Spirits.—Perhaps, said my Lord, they were so confin'd, when there, that now they rush out with greater Force; but be it as it will, I am vastly pleas'd to find Wit and good Sense so agreeably blended.—Conyers made the proper Reply, but retir'd pretty soon, for he wanted Repose.
NEXT Day they visited their Friends, and a Week was very chearfully employ'd. In this Time, Mr. Conyers receiv'd a Letter from his Correspondent in London, 
That he had credited him with the Money remitted from Cadiz; That he had paid three Bills drawn on him by Mr. Pensé, of Brussels, amounting to Seventy-five Pounds, and that his Correspondent of that City had advis'd him of the Death of the said Mr. Pensé.
—Captain Conyers was much concern'd for the poor Man, but his superior Joy soon got the better. He did not think on his Death, as so much gained, but determined to employ Pensé's Money to other Purposes than his own.

LORD TRUEGOOD had all the Softness and Delicacy of Behaviour; that Tenderness to Mankind; that Ease, and, at the same Time, that Dignity in his Deportment, that distinguishes, or ought to distinguish the Nobleman. He was Generous without Profuseness, Mild without Childishness, and Courteous to all; but supported his Station. He had seen the different States with critical Eyes, and observed the Faults and Perfections, with a View to the Good of his Country, and his own Honour. This Gentleman conceived a most particular Esteem for Captain Conyers, and every Day improved it.—To be applauded and regarded by Men of Sense and Knowledge, is the highest Honour a Man can receive. The Captain had this from Lord Truegood, and was sensible of it.
A LITTLE more Time was spent in Paris, in Compliments on taking Leave, particularly of the Marquis de Brissac, and the Duke d'Ayen.— Those paid to Ladies, I am as ignorant of, as the Reader.—Every Thing being prepared, the Three Friends took Post for Calais. The Packet soon landed them at Dover, and each had a peculiar Satisfaction at arriving at London.




CHAP. XX.


The grateful Mind a Pleasure feels
Beyond what Vice and Passion yields;
The grateful Heart a Bliss bestows
Beyond what Vulgar-Cunning knows.
This noble Virtue in the Breast,
Of ev'ry Virtue we're possess'd.

ANONIMOUS.



IT is not to be expressed, the hearty and affectionate Manner Sir Roger Thornton and Lord Mountworth received Captain Conyers, neither is it possible to describe the Joys He felt, when he embraced the Author of his Life, and the Founder of his Happiness. Each insisted on his living with them, and contended strongly about it, but Captain Conyers ended the kind Dispute by assuring them, he had many Reasons for being in private Lodgings, but hoped they would indulge him the Honour of visiting with Freedom.—He was presented to each Family, who could not enough admire the many excellent Qualifications they soon found he possessed. His generous Valour was the Subject of each Day, particularly

with the Ladies.—It is just They should peculiarly admire the Brave, when They only are capable of rewarding them.

LADY MOUNTWORTH still preserved a large Residue of Beauty. The accustom'd Sweetness of her Temper, and her good Sense, remained; but all her Charms seemed transplanted, and to blow a-fresh in her Daughter, Lady Harriot. She was now about Twenty-four Years of Age; her Beauty was exquisite, and none could be insensible of it; but the Rectitude of her Manners, the Integrity of her Soul, and the Affability of her Behaviour, could not fail of Numbers of Admirers. Perhaps she was too delicate in the Choice of a Husband, and required more Perfections in a Man, than a large Fortune and high Titles. She was so whimsical and singular in her Notions, that she thought a rational, tender, and faithful Companion, was infinitely more essential to a Scheme of Happiness, than a Multitude of Servants, and the most brilliant Retinue.—My Lord and Lady often raillied this Temper; but as they knew her Understanding and Judgment, they always left her Free.
CAPTAIN Conyers admired her Virtues. He was charmed at the easy Elegance of her Conversation. He gazed on her Beauties,

and his Heart insensibly stole from him, and became her Property.—Certain it is, Lady Harriot began to have Sentiments much in his Favour, and some delicate Expressions, and the Conduct of the Eyes, soon discovered what passed in their Souls.
THO' Lady Harriot possessed his Imagination, yet his private Affairs were attended to. Lord Mountworth was an excellent Adviser in Money Affairs, as well as other Matters. He therefore begged his Lordship's Assistance in the Management of Twenty Thousand Pounds, which brought on a Conversation that discovered the Circumstances of the Captain.—His Money was soon disposed of in the Funds, and he prepared to set out for his Estate. Whilst this was doing, he remembered his Promise to himself, and sent Five hundred Pounds of Mr. Pensé's to the Correspondent Society in London, for promoting English Protestant Schools in Ireland, but his Name was not mentioned.
HE likewise remembered his old Friend Mr. Sangfroid the Surgeon, and after much Enquiry, found him in very obscure Lodgings. The Captain was dressed in his Regimentals, and Sangfroid received him with very great Respect.—Sir, said he, I am sorry for your Accident. A slight Touch,

I presume, but my Care and Diligence, will soon make Matters easy to you, and you may depend on being quite safe in my Hands.—He was going on in the usual Stile; but the Captain with an hearty laugh, cry'd out, Bless me, Mr. Sangfroid!—Have you really forgot me?— Sangfroid looked up, and staring at him for some Time, cry'd,—Forget you!— —Eh!—Oons! I believe 'tis honest Conyers—Oh God! — Come to my Arms my dear Friend, said the Captain, and use me as such.—They embraced, and the Surgeon was quite confounded at his Appearance, and testify'd his Surprize. —We shall, said Conyers, have Time enough to talk of that, but at present let us think on your Affairs, for you do not seem so happy as I could wish. You have been my kind Benefactor, now try my Gratitude, and honestly tell me your Wants, for I fear you have some.

POOR Sangfroid began a most melancholy Story. He told the Variety of Misfortunes he had met with;—he placed them all to the Account of his Folly and Extravagance, and concluded by his being in a poor, wretched Condition.—His Story was extremely moving, but it convinced the Captain of the Misery That Man draws on himself,

who chuses to be directed by Passions and Appetites, rather than Prudence and Oeconomy.—However, he was determined to serve him, and put Forty Guineas into his Hands.—Now, said he, this is only for the present; when you find a Surgeoncy to be bought, command my Purse most freely.'—'Heavens! said Sangfroid, how ill they argue, that call this a bad World!—You are in it!—Ten such Men, attone for the Faults of Millions! —My dear Friend, continued he, with Tears in his Eyes, I believe some Relations would advance Two Hundred Pounds, if I had the Remainder I could this Moment purchase a Surgeoncy to a Regiment of Guards.—But 'tis impossible to expect so much Goodness.'— Expect, said Conyers every Thing from me. Go about it, my Friend, immediately, and in three Days I shall call and finish the Affair.—The Captain performed his Promise, and with the Assistance of £ 600 Mr. Sangfroid was made completely happy.
HIS next Enquiry was for Doctor St. Amour; but he had been lately made a Bishop in Ireland. He visited his good Widow Landlady in Surry, whom he made vastly happy, by a Present of Fifty Guineas,

and an Annuity of Ten Pounds a Year.—He found out that his old Master Monsieur Champignon had been sometime dead; and that Miss Tonton having the Guardianship of her own Person, had wisely disposed of it to a Life-Guard Man.—SIR PETER SHALLOW was still alive, and of the same weak Importance.—SIR JOHN CURIOUS was at Rest, but his Lady was very busy with a second Husband, whom she married in her Weeds.—Poor Mrs. CANNON had failed in some of her Annuities, and was obliged to retire to Yorkshire for Cheapness.—The BISHOP had long since been translated, and his Works followed him.—As to many others, whom he knew, he judged it not proper to renew his Acquaintance, or even inquire after. In a Word, he discharged all those Duties, that good Men recommend, and what few practice.
CAPTAIN Thornton had been so long absent from his Regiment, that he was oblig'd to take Leave of his Friends, and join his Post in Scotland, and his Father Sir Roger had been some Time in Berkshire on Business. This encreased the Intimacy of Captain Conyers with Lord Mountworth's Family, particularly with Lord Truegood.— He found out, by Degrees, the Situation

of Affairs, and that the young Lord's Brother Master William had taken a Fancy to the Sea Service, and had distinguished himself on many late Occasions as a Captain of a Man of War, and was then at his Station.
WHATEVER good Opinion the Family conceived of Capt. Conyers, an Affair happened that did not lessen it. It seems Mr. Sangfroid had been at the Captain's Lodgings, and was informed of his being at Lord Mountworth's. He followed, and tho' the Captain was not there, yet the Servant conducted him into the Chamber where sat my Lord and Lady with Lady Harriot. My Lord, with his usual Politeness, ordered a Chair, and told him he expected the Captain every Moment. A little Chat arose, which, at last, fell on his Friend. —Sangfroid was silent as to former Times, but mentioned his having been in good Circumstances, and had rendered some Services to Mr. Conyers. He then painted out the last Action of his Friend, and his real Worth and Honour in such lively Colours, that drew from my Lord and Lady, the highest Encomiums on the Captain. Lady Harriot was silent, but Pleasure blushed in her Face. — Sangfroid waited for some Time, but at last took his Leave.

LADY HARRIOT now opened on the Charms of Gratitude and true Generosity.— These, said she, are the masterly Touches of a finish'd Piece, and no Character can be compleat without them.—They argue every humane Sentiment, and are an Abstract of all Virtues.'—'Your Servant, Lady Harriot, said my Lord, and bowed, —I protest you would make an excellent Painter. But tell me, my dearest Harriot, Which would you chuse to trace, the Person, or the Mind of the Captain? —She blushed, but answered—You know, my Lord, I always speak Truth, and can ill disguise my Heart.—I hope I shall not be thought Criminal, when I assure your Lordship, I would chuse both his Person and his Mind.'—'And if I can, said my Lord, you shall have your Choice.'—He then most tenderly embraced her, and Lady Mountworth almost wept with Joy.

THE Captain was much pressed to return to the Country, particularly by Colonel Manly, who mentioned something of the Borough. It happened that the Colonel and Lord Mountworth were intimate Friends, so was easily persuaded to let his Son Lord Truegood accompany the Captain, but not before he had acquainted him with the

Sentiments of his Sister, and his own Inclinations to such a Match. The poor Captain scarcely knew how to bid Adieu to his dear Lady Harriot; but as he had given some Hints to Lord Truegood, his Lordship eased him in so delicate an Affair.— 
Lady Harriot, said he, I must beg your Hand to help me to raise my Friends for he is your's and you his.
—She saluted the Captain, and each attempted to answer the other.—These are broken Words, said my Lord, but we shall piece them together on our Return.—One Kiss more. —Now adieu.

THEY went to my Lord and Lady, who, as soon as acquainted with this Affair, embraced Mr. Conyers, and looked on him as a Son.—Your Lordship, said the Captain, is no Stranger to my Fortune, but this Paper contains an Abstract of it, and I most chearfully submit myself to your Lordship's Determination.—A few Compliments ensued, and Lord Truegood, with Capt. Conyers, stepped into their post Chaise, and soon arrived to the End of their Journey.



CHAP. XXI.


Our Grandsire Adam, ere of Eve possess'd,
Alone, and ev'n in Paradise unbless'd,
With mournful Looks the blissful Scenes survey'd,
And wander'd in the solitary Shade:
The Maker saw, took Pity, and bestow'd,

WOMAN, the last, the best Reserve of God.

POPE'S Jan. and May.



NEVER was Man received with more Affection, particularly by his Sister, the Colonel, and Doctor Grace.— It was a Jubilee in the Village.—The Remembrance of past, and the Enjoyment of present Happiness, occasioned many Tears. —He paid every Duty to Mrs. Sampson, and she regarded him as her Brother and her Son. He recited every Circumstance since they parted, and did not forget his Aunt Magragh at Cadiz, and proposed her living with her when she arrived in England.— Mrs Sampson was extremely pleased in his good Fortune; but, as she imagined the Colonel wished an Alliance with him, she hinted, that, perhaps, there was more in

Store.—Indeed, said she, I think you ought to marry; nor do I know a Woman in the World I would sooner recommend to you than Miss Manly.— She is grown a Delightful Creature, and is so good, I am sure she would make an excellent Wife. You know the Colonel has Fifteen hundred Pounds a Year, and a great Deal of ready Money. If you will set about it, I'il engage it shall be done.'—'My dear Sister, replyed Conyers, I know not how to thank you as I ought; but this Affair is impossible.— I am no Stranger to Miss Manly's Beauty and Merit; but we are not always Masters of our Inclinations.—He then told her the History of his Heart, and spoke so tenderly on the Charms of Lady Harriot, that she entirely agreed with him.
COLONEL MANLY was still hearty, and tolerably well. He was vastly pleased at the Figure and Behaviour of Lord Truegood. He spoke with great Pleasure of his Grandfather and the present Earl, and received him with the utmost Affection and Regard. They frequently dined with the Colonel, and Miss did the Honours of the Table in so polite and well-bred a Manner, that charm'd all, but particularly Lord

Truegood. He was struck with her Beauty, but the Elegance of her Conversation, firmly fixed every tender Thought.—Conyers perceived his Lordship's Anxiety, and guessing the Cause, hinted his Suspicion.— True, said my Lord, I own my Love, nor am I ashamed of it. An Object so infinitely worthy, must engross my Heart. Dear Conyers, let me require your Friendship. Assist me with the Colonel and his dearest Daughter, as I assisted you with Harriot. I am certain of my Father's Consent, and I shall be the happiest of Men.—The Captain, who was rejoiced at this Incident, assured him of his Interest, and the next Day, not only obtained the Colonel's Consent, but artfully found out from Miss, that my Lord was far from being disagreeable to her.—Lord Truegood was in Raptures, and the Friendship of Conyers curtailed a long Courtship, which of all People, Men of Sense and Sincerity are the least capable of doing for themselves. The Way being now paved, the Affair went smoothly on, and only wanted Lord and Lady Mountworth's Approbation.
The Captain resigned to the Colonel the Promise of his Interest for a Seat in Parliament, and begged him to transfer it where, soon, it would be naturally due. When

his Family Affairs were settled, they all agreed on a Journey to London; and, as the Colonel and Mrs. Sampson were infirm, they were obliged to make easy Stages. His Lordship daily made fresh Discoveries of the Understanding and good Nature of Miss Manly, and she found her Pleasure and Satisfaction arise, the more she conversed with him.—In short, it is not in Nature to give more real Joy, than what this good Company felt.
ON their Arrival in London, Captain Conyers flew to Lady Harriot, and Lord Truegood to his Father. One discovered his Soul more openly, and the other mentioned, what Lord Mountworth and my Lady were charmed to hear.
MATTERS were in this Situation, when HONOUR attacked the Captain with such Force, as almost to unhinge his flattering Hopes. This busy Companion seemed to hint, That he ought in Justice to make himself known to my Lord before the Marriage; that it would heighten his Character, and prevent the Imputation of an Impostor.— He owned the Truth of this, but at the same Time, he looked on his Person, Accomplishments and Fortune, as very far from Counterfeits. His discovering himself, gave him no Uneasiness, but he dreaded,

that his Love might be injured by it; and, as he could by no Means think of putting it to the Hazard, he determined still to be silent.—I write the Fact, and will neither approve or condemn this Conduct. The Truth is, he loved, and those who have felt that Passion, perhaps will make Allowances for the Faults it occasions.
WHY should I take up the Time of my kind Reader?—He will naturally suppose, that Visits were paid and returned;—That a Settlement was agreed on;—That the Lawyers were Fee'd, and all Necessaries done, to the finishing a Matter of such Consequence, but without my Help he will not know that Lady Harriot's Fortune was but Ten Thousand Pounds.
Two People, if not Four, imagined the Lawyers were very slow in their Motions, and the Clerks very dilatory in their Busisiness. A few Guineas enlivened their Pens, and the happy Day, at last came. The Bishop of—joined all their Hands, and established the Love and Affection of their Souls.

LORD MOUNTWWORTH would not too soon disturb the Pleasure of his Sons and Daughters, but in six Weeks, he began to think of returning to Ireland, from whence he had been absent three Years. As he

found Captain Conyers and Lady Harriot greatly inclined to go, he advised him to keep his Money Matters in such a Readiness, that he might dispose of it the first convenient Opportunity.—Whatever, said my Lord, some may imagine, let me advise you to Purchase in that Kingdom, but in one of those Counties the least improved. A Man of your Turn of Mind, will soon discover the many Advantages. You will build convenient Houses for the poor People, and set them a Spinning. You will almost compel them to Industry and Labour. They will thrive under you, and your Fortune increase in Proportion. —His Lordship then gave him an Account of his own Management, (as was formerly related) and assured him the People were all content, tho' his annual Income was augmented almost One Thousand Pounds.— —If, continued he, a Man takes a Pleasure in viewing the Trees he planted, in seeing them blossom, and in tasting their Fruit, what Joy, what a rational Joy must he receive, who beholds a Colony of human Creatures, established by his Care, flourishing by his Bounty, and Blessing his Soul, who blessed them?— Believe me, my dear Son, no Earthly Happiness can equal this.—The Captain

was too sensible of these Truths, not to agree with my Lord.—His Spirit was already in Ireland, and his Imagination planed out his future Conduct.
COLONEL MANLY grew impatient to return Home, there, as he said, to rest for ever. Lady Truegood could not think of quitting her Father, and the young Lord could not part from his dearest Wife, so that the old Gentleman was perfectly happy, when they agreed to accompany him. —He took a most tender Leave of all his Friends; but, embracing Conyers with Tears of the truest Affection, call'd him his Friend, his Soldier,—but could utter no more than, Heaven bless and protect you, and retir'd with Eyes full of the tender Passion, to which Lady Mountworth and Lady Harriot most liberally subscribed.
THE Captain took a good House and Garden at Richmond for Mrs. Sampson, who promised to be most careful of Mrs. Magragh when she arrived. He wrote to his Mother of all his Transactions, and gave her full Instructions. Every Thing being adjusted, this chearful and happy Family quitted London, and set out for Ireland.




CHAP. XXII.


The Wise new Prudence from the Wise acquire,
And one brave Hero sans another's Fire.

POPE'S Homer.


THE Journey was made less tedious by their sprightly and agreeable Conversation.—His Lordship often spoke of Ireland, but in such a Manner, as to remove the Prejudices he supposed Mr. Conyers might have to it.—The Face of the Country, said he, is certainly charming, and the Soil, the Rivers, and the Climate abundantly supply every Necessary for Life. It was formerly so Woody, that the Exhalations of the Earth were confined, and the Air wanted a Currency, consequently, it was very fatal to Strangers. Now indeed, you will find the other Extreme, and a shameful Neglect of Trees; but, as they have promised, so do they mend every Day.—You will be surprized at their Herds of Cattle. The City of Cork alone, slaughters for the West Indies above Eighty Thousand every Year. No doubt,

it is a profitable Branch, but so much Pasturage depopulates a Country, and makes the common People extremely poor and miserable. The Inhabitants seem now to have a Relish and a Taste for Industry, and they feel the Sweets of it. In many Things, no People act Wiser, and in others it is the Reverse, particularly in Corn. When a Scarcity happens, they all run to the Plow. Next Year, Corn is a Drugg, the Dutch buy it at their own Price, and the poor Farmers are undone. The following Year the Plow is neglected, and Corn again rises to an exorbitant Price, and then the Dutch return them their own.


I AM surprised, said Conyers, that their Experience has not convinced them of the Necessity of Granaries.'—'They much want them, replyed my Lord, but it must be an Affair of Government, for private Persons would be ruined in their Fortunes or Characters by such a Scheme.' —By what I have heard, said Conyers, it is a plentiful Country, and very Cheap.' —'True, answered Lady Harriot, and yet it is made much Dearer than in England. If Provisions be a Third Cheaper, and the Fashion of the Country obliges the Use of double Quantities, must it not be

more Expensive?'—'Well, well, said Lady Mountworth, suppose it dearer, and that they are not so rich as in England, they live well, they are a generous hospitable People, and have Spirits and Chearfulness, not to be purchased by mere Wealth. If they have Faults, shew me a Nation without them?'—'My Mistress said my Lord, is quite an Irish Woman.'— I believe, said she, my Dear means, I am quite unprejudiced; but, granting I was otherwise, ought I not to regard that Kingdom that maintains us? I wish every one did the same, and then their Poverty and Folly would not be so conspicuous.
WE are told, said the Captain, that the English Charter Schools are in a very flourishing Condition, and will, in Time, make it a Protestant Kingdom.'—'Yes, replyed my Lord, they are greatly, and very justly encouraged, but it will take Time to complete so laudable a Work, and Donations are still wanting.—Tho' it is the King of all Charities, yet I think my Plan would much shorten it.—Suppose the Legislator vested One Hundred Thousand Pounds in the Hands of a few Trustees of known Integrity and Judgment, to be applied in purchasing Lands

in some particular Counties, and letting those Lands in small Farms to poor Protestant Swiss or Palatines, naturalized, and to Protestant Husbandmen of our own Kingdoms. These Farms should be Rent Free for three Years; pay a small Matter for three Years more, and raise it in such a Proportion, as should be judged Equitable, till by Degrees the Lands paid the full Value, but not of the Improved Rent. They should have Fee Farm Leases, but not suffered to sell or alienate the Lands in any Shape, for a certain Number of Years, without the Consent of the Trustees.—Such a Scheme, properly executed, would certainly, in the first Instance, be Expensive to the Government, but it would, as certainly, soon fill the Country with Industrious and Faithful Subjects, and return to that Government a Ten-fold Interest.
AS ENGLAND, said the Captain, has purchased that Kingdom by much Blood and Treasure, perhaps they are too severe in their Conduct towards it. All confess the Policy of France, and their constant Maxim is, to grant more Privileges to their conquered Provinces and Towns, than they allow the Interior of the Kingdom.' —'On this, said my Lord, I shall not argue,

but, take Ireland in General, and you will find them tolerably happy. If all the proper Use be not made of so large a Kingdom, England will at last discover her Error, and rectify it. I must say for the Honour of Ireland, that no Nation ever made, in so short a Time, such wonderful Improvements; and I must add, that England has been, in many Instances, extremely Generous, and England begins already to feel and perceive the Utility of it.
AS to FRANCE, continued my Lord, I am convinced, that her great Strength lies not in the vast Superiority of her Dominions. We are told that Great-Britain and Ireland are to France, as 100 to 107. Her chief Power consists in the equal Distribution of Benefits to the Whole, and in her Scheme for making a formerly, divided People, now Think and Act as one Man.—Were we so True to our own Interest;—Were we so Industrious to procure to each other a reciprocal Advantage;—Did we manage every Inch of Territory for the Benefit of the Whole Community, and not Sacrifice the Bounties of Nature to the private Interest of a Few, GREAT BRITAIN, in Reality, would hold the Balance of Europe.—Lady Harriot

smiled, and said, I cannot but wonder at the vast Pains my Lord takes about Ireland, when, with all his Consideration, he cannot change the Nature of Things, but must leave them, almost where he found them: If he could persuade the Rulers of the State to think like him, then indeed I should have a Chance of seeing Ireland planted like a Garden.
GIVE me Leave to tell you, replied my Lord, that I apprehend it the indispensible Duty of every faithful Subject, to throw out such Information and Hints to the Government, as he judges of general Use. Should he err in his Conjectures, perhaps they may give Birth to somewhat really Beneficial. In any Case, his good Intentions will at least deserve Praise.— I am not such a Wind-Mill Fighter, as to pretend to amend the World, yet I hope your Ladyship will indulge me an Attempt to amend my little Share of it, and shew others a good Example.—According to my Notions, this is almost as essential a Part of my Duty, as to Fear God and Honour the King, neither can it justly be said, I do one or the other without it.


SUCH was the general Run of Conversation.—They pleased and instructed each other.—They spoke of Things with Freedom, but of Persons with Good-nature.— They had no Conception of the Joys of turning all into Ridicule;—of the Pleasure of Sarcasm, nor of the Delight of finding out Faults, and magnifying them.—No.— They had Souls above the vulgar Topic of Slander.—They loved Mankind, and Mankind loved them.

A YATCHT attended for my Lord and Family, and they arrived safe in Dublin the 16th of April, 1750. They stayed a short Time in that City, and then set out for BOUNTY-HALL. His Lordship's Tenants met him on the Road, and their unfeign'd Joy is past Description.
AS soon as Conyers perceived the venerable Seat, wherein he had experienced so much Humanity and so many Blessings, his Heart swell'd with Gratitude. Every tender Sensation rushed so violently on him, that he was scarce able to speak. Lady Harriot observed his Countenance changed, and was dreadfully frightened, as were my Lord and Lady. With some Difficulty he got into the House, and begged to lye down a few Minutes, and all would be well, but no Persuasion could remove Lady Harriot

from his Bed-Side. He indulged his Tears, and permitted them to flow in Silence, and unperceived by Lady Harriot.— In two Hours he was quite recovered, and joined the Family to their inexpressible Joy.
THO' he took Care not to enquire for particular Persons, yet he soon found, that the Good, the Honest Mr. Kindly, had been dead above two Years. This was a mortifying Blow, and cost him many Sighs. He had often figured to his Mind the Joy the Old Man would receive when he discover'd himself, which he intended to do, by reclaiming his Old Waistcoat and tatter'd Breeches.—All the Gratitude he had resolved to shew this Good Man, he now determined to transplant to his Family.—Mr. Cassock had been Minister of the Parish Eleven Years, and his Wife was well, and had a fine Family of Children. These he fix'd in his Thoughts.—The old Butler and Mrs. Mathews were dead.—Mademoiselle Le Meagre was old, but lived happily with Mrs. Cassock on a Pension from my Lord. The Good-natur'd Groom was a favourite Coachman, and had a considerable Farm, and was well married. Conyers determin'd in himself to do him Service.—He viewed the Land with the utmost Pleasure, but it was so changed, and the Inhabitants and

little Houses so alter'd and so decent, that all seemed Enchantment. With Difficulty could he persuade himself, that Eighteen Years could make such a wonderful Change. —Such is the Power of good Management, and such the Effect of Industry!
CAPTAIN CONYERS was in such vast Delight, that he fear'd he should discover himself improperly, and determin'd to watch a convenient Opportunity of opening his Heart to my Lord.—Thus they liv'd for two Months, when an Addition was made to the general Joy. In short, Lady Harriot could no longer hide a Pregnancy which she had taken great Pains to conceal.
HE soon found out, that his Good Friend DOCTOR ST. AMOUR, now Bishop of ****, lived about Twenty Miles from Bounty-Hall, which determin'd him to make an Excuse for visiting that Part of the Country.—He waited on the Good Man, from whose Character, it is easy to guess, how the Captain was received, for Advancement had only made him, if possible, more Humble.—Those who cannot imagine the Beauty of Good-nautre, Tenderness, Love, and Gratitude, must be very unhappy, and to attempt to describe what they do not understand, would be as absurd as to do it to those who have that Blessing.—Conyers

told him his Situation, and begg'd his Advice and Assistance in properly bringing about a Discovery to Lord Mountworth.— The Bishop took it on himself, but an Accident turn'd it another Way.
A FEW Days after his Return, my Lord heard of an Estate to be sold in the next County, and that the Proprietor was in Waterford. He knew the Lands and the Owner, and so much wish'd to have his Son fix'd there, that he proposed a Journey to Waterford, as the shortest and surest Way of coming to an Agreement. No doubt the Ladies were in some Trouble, particularly Lady Harriot, but his Lordship raillied them out of such Whimsies, and in three Days set out on this Expedition.



CHAP. XXIII.


Not He, of Wealth immense possest,
Tasteless who piles his massy Gold,
Among the Number of the Blest,
Should have his glorious Name enroll'd;
He better claims the glorious Name, who knows
With Wisdom to enjoy what Heaven bestows.

FRANCIS'S HORACE.



ON their Arrival at Waterford, they were inform'd, that the Gentleman they wanted was then at Clonmell, and next Morning they pursued their Journey to that City. In the Evening, they travell'd leisurely on, and my Lord was diverting him with a merry Story of his Youth, when suddenly Mr. Conyers cry'd out, Great God! and fainted in the Post-Chaise. — His Lordship, in prodigious Trouble, stopped the Chaise, and all were employed in recovering the Captain. They took him out, and no House being at Hand, carry'd him to the Hut of a Beggar. When his Senses weree recall'd, what was his

Astonishment at finding himself actually placed in his first Habitation!—He utter'd some Words that greatly affected his Lordship, who imagined a Lightness in the Brain, and made him most ardently desire to be in a Place where proper Assistance could be had.—In a little Time his Spirits so much revived, that my Lord hurry'd him into the Chaise, and the Beggar had Reason to be thankful for the Accident.
THE CAPTAIN was lost in Thought. The Idea of former Times was so strong, and every childish Circumstance recurr'd so clearly to his Memory, that it might have been fatal to him, had not his Eyes given Vent to the Throbbings of his Heart.— This lasted a considerable Time; but he was quite himself when he arrived at Clonmell.


MY dear Conyers, said my Lord, you give me vast Pain; I perceive your Disorder is not occasioned by Sickness, but by somewhat that oppresses your Mind. —Relieve it, I beseech you, and confide in me, not merely as a Father, but as a Friend.—If my Power or Fortune can give you Ease, count it already done. Let me intreat you not to stifle your Cares, if you have any, which must torture

your Imagination, and keep me on the Rack.


HEAVEN is my Witness, said Mr. Conyers, I mean not to give your Lordship the least Uneasiness. But, my Lord, I have such a Tale of Wonder to unfold, that overcomes my Reason.—Can you believe, can your Lordship imagine, that the Hovel I was just now in, was my Dwelling for Years?—My Lord thought him distracted, and advis'd him to forbear any further Relation, and go to Rest.

I SEE, said Mr. Conyers, your Lordship thinks my Mind is disturb'd.—'Tis true; but my Reason is clear.—Oh, my Lord! I am not capable of injurious Deceits, but that I have deceived you, is certain.' 'My dear Son, reply'd the good Lord, I know your Honour, and your Virtue, but I know not of a Deceit.'— Yes, my Lord, answer'd Conyers, you are my Father; — your Bounty rais'd me;—your Humanity supported my Infant Weakness;— your Virtues form'd my Soul;—the Will of the Almighty has conducted my Steps, and now throws at your Feet, the Poor, — the Helpless, —the Abandon'd JACK CONNOR.

LORD MOUNTWORTH was all Amazement.—He forgot Mr. Conyers was on his

Knees, but gazing, with Eyes of Astonishment, at last he rais'd him, and look'd again.—When he had fully brought to his Memory the long unthought-of Features of Jack Connor, he flew with Transport to his Arms.—Gracious Heaven! cry'd he, how unsearchable are thy Ways.—Oh, my dear Jack, you have amply,—amply rewarded the Kindness I have shewn you. —You are now mine by every Tie.'— If your Lordship, said Conyers, can pardon the only Fallacy I was ever guilty of, you will, a second Time, give me Life and Being.'—'My dear Jack, reply'd my Lord, you every Moment give me new Pleasure;—I think you are now my son more than ever:—But, my Child, tell my impatient Ear how this Wonder has happen'd;—tell me how it is possible, when Mr. Johnston was so certain of your being drown'd, that I now find, now hold you in my Arms!'—'I shall, answer'd Mr. Conyers, most faithfully inform your Lordship of every Part of my Life, but the Hurry of my Spirits is so great, and my Imagination, so fill'd with the Vicissitudes of my Fortune, that I am unable, at present to utter any Part. —All I can now say, is, most humbly to thank your Lordship, for your Humanity and Bounty,

to a Poor, Distressed, Helpless Infant, and to beseech you, to believe, that nothing but Real Love, of my dearest Harriot, and the dread of losing her, could have prevented a sooner Discovery. Forgive this Crime, my Lord, if Love can be a a Crime; and your Lordship may be assured, that my Duty, my Gratitude, and every Sentiment of an Honest Heart, shall for ever wait on you, and on every Creature for whom you have the least Friendship or Regard.


MY dear Son, said my Lord, I can easily judge of the pleasing Anxiety you are in, but retire to Rest, and may gentle Sleep, restore your Peace and Tranquillity; and may Heaven long continue it.

Next Morning, Lord Mountworth in the most affectionate Manner, embraced Conyers, and call'd him his Son,—his Friend.— Permit me, said the Captain, to ask your Lordship, if you can give me any Account of Mr. Johnston's Niece Nannett?' —'To the best of my Memory, said my Lord, she married Mr. Lilly the Usher, about the Time you left the School. Your old Master died Six Years ago, and Mr. Lilly continues the former Plan of Tuition, with great Credit.



NOW I am satisfied, said Conyers; and now give me Leave to recount every Circumstance of my Story, and your Lordship will observe the visible Hand of Providence conducting and leading me to the Fruition of the most perfect Happiness this World can afford.—It has conducted me to the Arms of the dearest and best of Wives, and to the Sight of the noblest and best of Men. —Heaven, I beseech thee, make me most truly thankful.

HE then began the Narrative of his Life, which, if the Reader has forgot, he has my Permission to read again, for I have not Time to Recapitulate.

EVERY Incident and Change of his Life, gave his Lordship fresh Matter for Wonder; but what struck him the most, was his being the Son of Sir Roger Thornton, who had married his Sister.—I shall ever, said he, admire your Prudence, in keeping your Affairs so secret, and I shall always Honour your laudable Ambition and Gratitude.—When our dear Harriot has bless'd you with a Child, both she and my dear Wife shall partake of the Joy your Story has given me, and my Son Harry, must share in the Pleasure.—As for Sir Roger, he must know nothing of

it, for he has a certain Pride in his Nature, that would soon divulge it to the World, and, perhaps, not in its genuine Colours.—For my own Part, my dearest Jack, I am so far from being ashamed of your Alliance, that I glory in it; yet, my Son, I would not chuse to be the constant Theme of the Ignorant.— TITLES are but the Rewards of Merit, but Pride and Haughtiness debase them.— Distinctions, are only Incentives to Noble Deeds; and true Nobility will ever encourage them. — Charity and Tenderness, are the Characteristicks of A MAN, and did Mankind love Truth and Honour, more than Pride, Falshood and Detraction, the Occurrences of your Life would strengthen their Resolves, and convince ALL,— That to be REALLY HAPPY, they must be TRULY VIRTUOUS.


Gentle Reader,

RIGHT sorry is the Compiler of this Work, that his Materials can carry him no further, and he is not permitted to to search into Futurity. Should our good JACK CONNOR, or CAPTAIN CONYERS, live Thirty or Forty Years longer, perhaps he will furnish Matter for a much abler Historian. The Work thou hast now

read, has been little alter'd from the Original Papers, but some Observations, or rather slight Hints, have been added, and are the Result of not a little Experience of Sixty Years.—If thou findest Errors, reprove with Freedom, but judge of the Intention. —If thou applaudest any one Part of the Moral, thou wilt make the Compiler happy, as he will imagine thou wilt follow the Precept.—To the well-minded, to the honest Man, he says from Shakespear's CORIOLANUS,

I have done, as you have done; That's, what I can;

Induc'd, as you have been; That's, for my Country;

He, that has but effected his Good-will,
Hath overta'en mine Act.


FAREWELL.

THE BOOKSELLER TO THE READER.
THE History of JACK CONNOR having met with so favourable a Reception in Great Britain and Ireland, that my Interest obliged me to give this Second Edition, tho' Books of Amusement, do not always meet the same Fate. No Pains has been wanting, to make this Impression as compleat, as the Nature of the Work would admit of.
SOME Gentlemen have insisted on my rescuing the following Letters from Oblivion, by adding them to this Volume; and I was

the easier prevailed on, as they bear some Analogy to the foregoing History.
I find these Letters were printed in London, in the Paper call'd the FOOL, at a Time when it was under the Consideration of Parliament, whether they should, or should not, continue the Bounty on the low-pric'd Linens of Ireland.

IF Irony merits your Attention or Regard, these Letters cannot fail of giving you some Pleasure, which, I shall ever be happy, by contributing to.




LETTER I. To the FOOL.

Dear Cousin,
LONDON, 1748.


HAD I sooner discovered the Honour I have of being nearly related to you, sooner had I paid my Respects to the worthy Head of so illustrious a Family.
TO convince you of my sincere Love, untainted with Flattery, permit me grievously to complain to you—of yourself. The constant Maxim of our glorious Ancestors, was, by their Writings, their Eloquence, and every other lawful Means, to encourage, promote, and, if possible, make Universal the great Doctrine of Folly; but, with an aching Heart I speak it, you seem to dwindle from the fundamental Rule into downright Understanding and Sense.

CONSIDER, my dear Cousin, that whilst you are musing yourself with such Trifles, your natural Enemies gain Ground; nay, a

whole neighbouring KINGDOM have lately taken up Arms against Us, who for many Centuries were our firmest Friends and Allies.

YOUR inherent Good-foolishness will naturally imagine I mean IRELAND.— This mighty Monarchy, for ages governed by Kings of our House!—This extensive Realm, famous for the Title of Isle of Saints, the indelible Character of our noble Family! — This State, peculiarly cherished and fed by our spiritual Father the Pope!—And yet, to our Shame be it spoken, this, so valuable a Part of our Dominions is likely to be wrested from Us. —Yes, Sir, we shall soon lose our ancient Inheritance, except we exert all our Faculties, and by vigorous, and antisalutary Schemes, prevent what must be so fatal to our Interest.
LEST Truth should not have reached your Ears, (as what Monarch always hears it) permit me to inform you of the present Conduct of this DEGENERATE NATION.— Your Foolishness will scarcely believe the melancholy Tidings I bring!—You will not be able to conceive, that these, your old Friends, now hold your Authority and Family in the utmost Contempt!—That they have already trampled down Numbers of

your Altars and High-places, and that all Hands are employed to finish the execrable Work!—Believe me, Sir, this misguided People, are totally employed in promoting Manufactures, Labour, and Industry! Strange Revolution!
AS poor and deluded as they are, they have stumbled on a Project, that will infallibly ruin our Credit.—They have set the Axe to the Root, and the mighty Tree, that yielded the plentiful and delicious Fruit of Pardons, Indulgencies, and a thousand other Sorts, no less grateful to the Soul, must fall, and with it all our Hopes!—In short, Sir, the Wretches seem determined to make it a PROTESTANT KINGDOM.—I tremble at the Consequence!
BLIND ZEAL urges them on. They give their Money with Chearfulness to promote their Darling Scheme of ENGLISH PROTESTANT WORKING SCHOOLS.—I beg Leave, Sir, to set this Matter before you, in its true Light, that your Foolishness may consider of Ways and Means to prevent their spreading.

I AM very well informed that this Kingdom from N. to S. is about 265 Miles, and from E. to W. about 150, and contains about eighteen Millions of statute Acres, with commodious Harbours, Bays, and Rivers.

—Henry the second stole it from your Ancestors.—Many Struggles were made by our good Friends to shake off this Yoke, but in vain.—At that Period, vulgarly called The Reformation, your Friends held fast to Mother Church, but still PROTESTANTISM impudently raised her Head and shamefully flourished. To such an Height she grew, that in 1641, when England was torn by Civil War, our natural Safety obliged, and our Holy Catholick Church compelled Us, for the Sake of Salvation, to extirpate our Enemies. The glorious Call was unhappily obeyed, but in Part; for their fell, in that Night, but about ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND of them.
THAT Arch-Fiend OLIVER CROMWELL, greatly disturbed our Peace and holy Ignorance. His enthusiastick Sword swept all before him. His Madness drove Multitudes to America, and Numbers into one Corner of the Land, where still your Name is in some Veneration.—The total Ruin of your Empire was too arduous a Task even for Oliver, for on mustering our Forces in 1683, we found ourselves 37 to one.
AGAIN we struggled, and followed the Standard of your illustrious God-Father, KING JAMES the Second.—Tho' the PRINCE OF ORANGE was our most inveterate Foe;

tho' he had a little Courage, great Cunning, and a tolerable Army, our Hopes were High, and we might have succeeded, had not that abominable filthy Town and Neighbourhood of ENNISKILLEN, raised a Regiment of HORSE, and one of FOOT, of as rank PROTESTANTS as ever occupied Church Lands, and sent Them and Their Hearts to the PRINCE.—Oh fatal Hour! — Our Enemies Triumph in it, and preserve these Regiments, even until this very Day.

FROM that Time, these Miscreants have been but too careful in framing, and what is worse, putting in Execution sundry Laws, destructive of our antient Rights. Thus have they proceeded for these sixty Years, without the least Check; and have so artfully managed their Affairs, that, withal the Machinations and Contrivances, of sundry Potentates, your Friends and Allies, they never could be brought even to think of REBELLION in support of your Foolishness, or Family, except with Horror.—So averse were these Savages to your gentle Sway, that, whilst Numbers of our Relations marched, even into the Heart of England in your Cause: They, the Protestants, raised upwards of sixty thousand Horse and Foot, well armed, regimented, and mostly uniformly cloathed, and effectually guarded IRELAND,

in spite of your legal Prerogative, and indefeasible Hereditary Right.

I HAD a Degree of Happiness, on being informed that in 1742, our Friends there were about seven to one Enemy.—But alas, Sir! on further Enquiry, I am, but too well convinced, that in fifty Years, you, or your Posterity, will not have a single Heart warm in your Cause.—The Encouragement given to Husbandry, Manufactures, Arts and Sciences, is monstrous! Even beyond what any other Nation ever did!—They have inverted the whole Order of Nature; they have extracted Corn from our old venerable Boggs, and feed Millions of Sheep and Oxen, on those Plains, antiently consecrated to holy and religious Uses.—But what will not Impiety do?
THEY have infatuated the native Irish to such a Decree, that they beg and pray to have their Children admitted into these cursed Protestant Schools, now erected in most Parts of the Kingdom, to the Number of 50.—In these Seminaries they are taught to read the Bible, and instructed in their Religion for about two Hours every Day, and the Remainder of their Time, still more infamously, employed in tilling the Land, spinning, weaving, or some other

manual Operations, unknown to their Fore-fathers.

THE FUND to answer this great Expence, arises, from what they call, THE CHARITY OF WELL DISPOSED CHRISTIANS; and so prevalent is this specious Title, that a KING, (whom your Foolishness never heard of,) even GEORGE THE SECOND, has granted them a Charter, and set an Example to his Subjects, by a Donation of ONE THOUSAND POUNDS a Year.—An Example! but too well followed by Numbers of weak Minds in this Kingdom.
I REALLY always imagined that these Contributors were of the lowest Order of the People; but great was my Surprise to find, at a late Meeting, so many of the first Fashion and Reputation in the Kingdom. As they are Men of dangerous and turbulent Spirits, always plotting and contriving our Ruin, they must, by some Means or other, be diverted from this Work.
YOUR Foolishness will certainly demand and say,—Where are my holy Priests?— They are idle!—They are idle!—No, Sir, accuse them not; they are there, and in Numbers, and at Work with all their Might; but these subtile Protestants take from them the Tools they work with, by transplanting

the innocent Children many Miles distant from their native Parishes; by which Contrivance, their Parents, or Priests, are prevented from frightening them with Purgatory and Hell, or keeping them firm in the Cause of Indolence and Rags.—For now above 1500 of these little Reptiles Cloath themselves.
PERMIT me, Sir, in my next, to lay before you a few Remarks, and some Schemes to render Useless the Machinations, of all your Enemies, being


Your true and most affectionate Kinsman, Thomas à Stupidius.





LETTER II. To the FOOL.

Dear Cousin,
LONDON, 1748.


IN the last I had the Honour of writing to you, I traced out the Rise and Progress of WISDOM in your antient Kingdom of IRELAND.—Permit me, a little, to continue the Subject, and then I shall mention my Ways for making their Wisdom abortive.
SOME of their Wise Heads have found out, that Ireland contains about two Millions of Inhabitants, and they have likewise found out, that the Riches and Prosperity of a Nation are in Proportion to their Inhabitants properly employed.—Such a Discovery was infinitely against the true Interest of our Family.—On this they built, and then computed the Value to the Government of every industrious Individual, which, I think, they made amount to about ten Pounds a Year.

THEY then proceeded by a Thing called Arithmetick.—If ONE industrious Subject— be worth TEN POUNDS a Year to the State, —what will be the Value of TWO MILLIONS of such Subjects?—And, such is the Power of Figures! They made it plain that that Number was really worth TWENTY MILLIONS each Year.
IN order to acquire such Riches, the first Care of these avaritious Gentry was to poison the Minds of their Tenants with Notions of Industry.—No easy Task! But as they knew, that the Popish Religion,—their having such Swarms of Priests to maintain,— their Number of Holy Days,—and their natural Disposition to Sauntering, were so many Draw-backs to Wealth, Honesty, and Cleanliness, it was thought necessary to change the Religion of the People, and make them spurn at our holy Institutions.— This cruel Blow has been but too well followed; — Their Labour and Industry have matched with such gigantick Strides, that within these twenty Years, the whole Face of the Country is changed.—Now the Traveller journies on Roads the finest in Europe, and reposes himself, not in Barns, or Hovels, but in good, clean, and commodious Houses.—He may in Time be entertained with all the Beauties of the Country,

heightned and improved by Art and Industry.—He may behold useful and ornamental Structures arise; and see Gardens and Plantations flourish.— These indeed would be shocking Sights!
'TIS amazing to observe, how the trivial Praemiums of a little Society in DUBLIN have spurred on greedy Minds.—Scarcely has any Branch of Manufacture, or useful Art, escaped their Notice and Encouragement.—Such low Creatures are they, that they ransack even the Dunghills, and give Praemiums to the old Women, who gather most Rags to make Paper.—Should our Schemes oblige the Rebels to return to your Obedience, I would except these Fellows out of the general Pardon.
WHAT have we not to fear, should Industry, like other Novelties, become a Fashion in Ireland.—INDUSTRY! The Parent of every social Virtue;—the Founder of all real Honour;—the Support of Government, and Preserver of true Religion!— PROPERTY is her constant Attendant, and LIBERTY gives her Spirits freely to enjoy it.—Virtue, Property, and Liberty, are not Concomitants of our Constitution. They must be banished, or your Foolishness will be deposed. Therefore, THE PROTESTANT WORKING SCHOOLS must be destroyed.


HITHERTO, Sir, I have considered this Matter in its worst Light; but be assured your Foolishness has many and powerful Friends both Here and in Ireland, who constantly espouse your Cause. These Forces, properly collected, and well posted, must make a powerful Diversion, and greatly Retard the Operations of the Enemy.

OUR Friends in the CONCLAVE and SORBONNE perfectly understand the noble Doctrine,—DIVIDE AND GOVERN.—Through all the Labyrinths of Policy, from Xenophon, and Tacitus, to Richlieu and Anti-Machiavel, this Maxim is the Soul and Essence.— When it fails, I know but of a Ponyard or Poison that can supply its Place.
RIGHTLY to divide, we must sub-divide Truth: Or, in other Words, we must propagate Falshoods. 'Tis certain, that Lying is a Sin the Vulgar only can commit; for all the Princes of your House gloried in it; and your Foolishness follows those bright Examples.—Let it be privately hinted, That the whole Affair is a Jobb, and a Contrivance to couzen the Weak.—Assert possitively, that every Donation to these scandalous Working Schools, centers in the Pockets of particular Persons,—or, where these Schools are really erected, 'tis but with a View of augmenting the Estate of the Lord of the

Manor, by having so many Slaves to work for him gratis. Thanks be to Ignorance Thousands of your Liege Subjects will subscribe to these Articles, with Implicit Faith.

THO' it happens, that GREAT-BRITAIN and IRELAND are governed by the same Monarch, and the same Laws, and tho' the principal Inhabitants of the latter, spring from the former, yet Nature, indulgent to your Interest, has divided them by a little Sea.—Be it therefore our peculiar Care to divide their Minds, by encouraging Jealousy, and the salutary Seeds of Derision and Animosity.—By all Means, prevent the English from ever getting the better of their Prejudices to the Irish, and keep the Irish in a perpetual envious Disposition to the English. For, though we cannot prevent their being IN FACT but one and the same People, this Conduct will give them two distinct Minds, and make their UNION useless.

EVERY Instrument must be employed to keep up the general Opinion, that Ireland must be bridled and curbed.—Never permit them to discover, that it would be unjust to make different Laws for the Isle of Wight, or, that the County of Surry should have less Freedom than the County of Middlesex; because the Thames divides them.—How

fatal had it been to our good Cause, and to our faithful Friends, the Disturbers of Europe, had Ireland been joined to the narrow Part of the Western Shore of England!—They would then have been all Protestants.—This Kingdom would have been Two Thirds larger than it is,—have had four or five Millions more of Inhabitants, and a proportionable Increase of Taxes to the Government; consequently the Government less in Debt, if at all; or, if in Debt, better enabled to pay that Debt. —France and Spain would have been unsupplied with Irish Officers and Soldiers, who happen, though our Relations, not to be the worst of the Profession.
THAT your Foolishness has many Friends of different Orders, cannot be denied; but the Two most firm in your Interest, are those Gentlemen of England, who regard the other Isle but with a certain Degree of Contempt, and view the Inhabitants but as Aliens to the State: And those Gentlemen of Ireland, who contemning her new-adopted Maxims, live out of her Pale, nor visit her, but by their Proxies in the Form of Bills of Exchange.—These are our true and genuine Subjects, meriting every Honour your Foolishness can confer on them.

IT must be confessed, there are some poor and dastardly Spirits in this Kingdom, who, afraid of exerting their Power over the other, have, unaccountably, run into the opposite Extreme, and joined with all their Might to promote their Linen Manufacture. Nay, their MONARCH, and most of his Nobility, feel it every Day on their Tables, their Backs, and in their Beds.—Too serious a Truth!—I have been informed, that in 1681, their whole Export of Linen Cloth amounted to about ten Thousand Pounds, but now,—Can you believe it?—'Tis swelled to above a Million. This has so enraged me, I am not at present able to proceed; but permit me to refer your Foolishness to my next, and always be assured of the utmost Sincerity of


Your most faithful and affectionate Kinsman, Thomas à Stupidius.





LETTER III. To the FOOL.

Dear Cousin,
LONDON,
1748.


JOIN with me to curse the Memory of the old Wretch, who invented the Fable of the Belly and Members. Certainly it contains more Wisdom than half the modern Folios. From this Tale sprung every faint Endeavour to make these three Kingdoms subservient to the Interest of each other, and BE in Reality one great and mighty Empire. But their boasted TRIA JUNCTA in UNO is merely ideal; for our Family have ever found Means, nor wanted Interest, to make ineffectual such pernicious Schemes.


LINEN gave Rise to Industry in IRELAND.—Industry soon shewed her alluring Charms, and diffused her baneful Influence over the Land. Ten Thousand odious Beauties issued from her, and at last produced

these horrid working Schools, which must make it a Protestant Kingdom, and consequently enrich England, by an Addition of some Millions of useful and faithful Subjects.

ENGLAND discovered this Benefit, and wisely encouraged the Irish Linen; but particularly by the Bounty they allowed on its being exported to foreign Countries. The Effects were soon felt in Ireland, and the Creatures expressed their aukward Gratitude, by running in Crouds to the Hackle and Loom.

AS this is the Source of all our Misfortunes in Ireland, let all our Attention be given to Ruin it; which, when once effected, believe me Sir, they will fly with more Alacrity, to bend the Knee before you, than they did to rebel against your Authority.—Let us not tamely submit to see triumphant those Monsters, Industry and Protestantism.—Our Troops are still numerous, and in good Order; but alas! of what Use, if not led to on Action.
Your Foolishness knows, that some of the Northern Provinces of this Kingdom have embarked in this Branch of Business. —A most lucky Incident! which, if properly improved, all your Wishes will be accomplished.—Let us magnify their Performances.—Let

us invent plausible Tales of the Progress they have made, and fee our Friend SOPHISTRY to demonstrate, that the Interest of England requires their being greatly supported and encouraged, and then your faithful Minister CUNNING may slyly insinuate, that Ireland can now stand alone, nor needs the usual Bounty, which, by all true Policy, ought to bend its Course due North.

I AM in Raptures at the Thought!— Pursue it, Sir, in the Name of Ignorance; and instantly you will see, all their mighty Fabrick tumble to the Ground, and your Fame will be exalted for ever!—Ireland must then infallibly become a Drain of Riches from England, and not a Source of Plenty.—She may want Assistance from England, but will never be able to return the Compliment.—Thus enervated, no more can she support thirty seven Regiments of British Subjects, always ready to obey their Monarch.—She may indeed have an Army quartered on her; but their Pay must issue from the same Fountain, which supplies the Army in Scotland.—Her present Absentees must then become Resident; for, by Ruining this, her only Branch of valuable Commerce, she can never send out the

twentieth Part of the annual Million, she now bestows on them.
'TIS impossible to mention the innumerable Advantages arising to us from such a Project well executed.—ROME would be glad, and France rejoice at it.—Ignorance would triple her Number of Beads. Sloth would multiply her pleasant Bogs, and Indolence live magnificently in Smoak, and Mudwalls! In fine, all our Family, to the most distant Relation, would be properly and munificently provided for, and your Throne established, as in the Days of Roderick O'Connor, of gallant Memory.
'TIS in vain to attempt in England a thorough Reformation in our Favour; but we can always throw in such Bars to their Happiness, and so weaken the Nerves and Sinews of their Government, that all their Conquests over us shall avail them little, or perhaps even become a Charge to them.

DULLNESS be praised, all Thoughts are now dropt of making Ireland a Corn Country. I own, I am surprised their Clergy do not attempt it, as it would so much encrease their Tythes. They have talked of publick Granaries, but it was meer Talk; nor shall I remind them of it.—Indeed an Attempt was once made to encourage Tillage, by granting, as in England, a Bounty

on Corn exported; but your Foolishness nobly exerted yourself on that Occasion, and defeated the Project. You rightly judged, that though Pasturage employed the Land, it was in no Shape so prejudicial to your Interest as Ploughing, which fills a Country with laborious Inhabitants.

WITHOUT Vanity I may say, I gave the first Hint of restraining Ireland, with Regard to WOOLL, and then, I dexterously contrived, that the English might smuggle it as well as themselves. The happy Consequence is, that Thousands of the French are amused in manufacturing of it, whilst as many of your Rebel Subjects are starving at Home.—To my great Joy, this cannot suddenly be alter'd; for so long as the Irish love Mutton, and feed Millions of Sheep; and so long as they have more Wooll, than their home Consumption requires, so long will they act on the Principles of their Neighbours, and sell it to the best Bidder.—Perhaps your Foolishness will be surprized, that so large a Kingdom as France or Spain should want Irish or English Wooll: But—let me wisper in your Ear.—All their Wooll cannot make one Piece of Serge.—Why this is so, LEEDS, and every Cloathing Town in England can better explain than I.—Should they ever attempt a Change in this Matter, let us get a

Burrough or two to petition against it, and order your Brother CLAMOUR to attend.— They are truly, in this Respect, in the Way we wish them in; nor do I believe they will alter, till they are convinced, That it is more eligible to encourage the Subjects of Ireland in some certain Branches of Trade, than by a contrary Conduct, drive those Branches into the Arms of the common Enemy.

THE general Rule, and the most successful is, eternally to play one Part of the Monarchy against the other, and constantly to keep up that noble Spirit of Grumbling, and turning every Act of their Government into Ridicule. What MACHIAVEL says of a Prince, may well be applied to GREAT-BRITAIN and Ireland. 
They ought above all things carefully to avoid rendering themselves odious or despicable; for such a Conduct protects them from every Danger.—Could we contrive, not only to make them odious and despicable in the Eyes of their Neighbours, but likewise to each other, how happy should we be!
MAY our Endeavours prosper! and may your Foolishness once more shine on the Throne of your Ancestors!—May ENGLAND think hardly of SCOTLAND.—May

SCOTLAND abuse IRELAND.—And may IRELAND envy one, and reproach the other!—May this regular Confusion have no End, until that Day, when your Foolishness, in the Fullness of your Glory, shall say, Now indeed are ye all my Children.

SHOULD the Reverse happen, and their Wisdom prevail over us.—Should the PROTESTANT WORKING SCHOOLS in Ireland continue to be supported by the Charity of England, without which they cannot subsist.—Should the Linen Manufacture of that Kingdom, instead of being ruined, become more powerfully protected and encouraged by this.—Should they fall on equitable Ways, to prevent exporting Wooll to France. In short, should they become Wise and Industrious, and by the natural Union of the Members to the Head, assist and not destroy each other. Should these come to pass, what must become of Us, and Our numerous Offspring!—Forbid it, all ye Gods of Error!—O Misery! all that could remain for us, would be to fly to ROME, AVIGNON, Boulogn, or St. Germains.—There bemoan our unhappy Fate, talk of our former Splendor, and live on the Bounty of

our Relations; for work we cannot, but to beg we are not ashamed.—There with my latest Breath I shall honour and revere your Name, and expire in a Wish for your Restoration. I am with all Duty,


Your most faithful and Affectionate Kinsman, Thomas à Stupidius.

FINIS.
